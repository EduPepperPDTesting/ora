<p>A group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation.</p>

<h5>Procedure:</h5>

<ol>
<li>Determine the mass of four different samples.</li>
<li>Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical, containers. </li>
<li>Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container.</li>
<li>After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.</li>
<li>Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. </li>
<li>Determine the mass of each sample. </li>
</ol>

<p>The students’ data are recorded in the table below.</p>
