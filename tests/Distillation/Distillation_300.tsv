This cannot bring the solution 100% ethanol  due to the eutectic occurring in the middle of the diagram  as soon as the composition reaches this eutectic it will either fall into the liquid or vapor area  and will not be able to incorporate any more ethanol into the solution."
0	"An azeotrope is a liquid mixture of two or more components having a unique constant boiling point and fixed  and that passing into the vapor state behaves as a pure compound  or as if it were a single component. To get a purer compound will need to use special resources such as azeotropic distillation. For example  if subjected to a simple distillation a mixture of 50% ethanol 50% evaporating the mixture obtained two products: pure water in background (~ 25% ethanol)  and a distillate with a higher ethanol concentration (~ 74%). If this mixture is distilled again a 2nd distillate obtained with an ethanol concentration of about 82%. A 3 rd distillation distillate will throw an ~ 87% ethanol. As shown in the figure  successive distillations to approximate the distillate composition of the azeotrope (95% ethanol)  but never pure ethanol."
0	"you would boil the solution and then lower the temperature.  as more water drops out  the vapor becomes more ethanol rich as it follows the curve to the right until it hits the percentage you are looking for.  seperate the vapor and then condense it.  you couldn't reach 100% with this because it would stop at the eutectic point  about 95%."
0	"From the diagram I can see that for temperatures around 90 degrees  the liquid phase is mostly water. In particular the concentration of ethanol in the liquid phase seems to be significantly less than 15%.So I could heat the solution to 90 degrees then remove the liquid  and then cool the vapor to obtain a higher % ethanol liquid. I could repeat this process several times.I cannot enrich the solution indefinitely in this way for the following reasons:Looking at the right side of the diagram  I see that eventually there comes a point when there are no mixed phases anymore. Also  to the far right  it looks like the ethanol has a higher concentration in the vapor phase than in the liquid phase."
0	"Ethanol evaporates at a lower temperature than water. Through a destillation process  you could separate the phases  thus allowing to obtain an enriched mixture of water and ethanol. However  100% ethanol can not be ontained because through heat  water molecules dissipate in air  therefore some water would go along with the ethanol."
0	"Let's assume first the solution is at room temperature.Increase temperature until solution reaches equilibrium liquid and vapour state. Increase the temperature more and the solution starts to evaporate. As solution contains more water than ethanol a bigger proportion of water evaporates hence the ethanol percentage increases.Continue the process increasing slowly the temperature and keeping the solution in liquid and vapour equilibrium until ethanol reaches 50 percent."
0	"this procedure could not be used to reach 100% pure alco.  because there will be always a part of water which we cant separate while we are behind azeotropic point. behind this point water and ethanol are unseparable from each other thanks to the same boiling point."

These two evaporate at different temperatures  water at 100 Celsius and  ethanol at 78.5 Celsius (according to the diagram)  so to be able to reach a 100% pure ethanol would be needed water to evaporate at a lower temperature that ethanol. We have an eutectic point at 95% ethanol."
0	"Before we start  we need to identify the boiling points of the two components:Water: 100CEthanol: 78.5CAs we can see in the diagram  the initial solution exists as liquid at a temperature below the boiling point of ethanol  and the final solution that we need to obtain exists at a temperature ~70C. So in order to enrich the initial solution  we could increase the temperature of the initial solution to approximately 80C  then extract the vapor that we produced because at that temperature the final solution exists in two phases (liquid + vapor) so we're able to begin the decrease of the temperature of the vapor we obtained before at a final temperature below at 78C  in order to obtain the solution  in the liquid state  that we need (60% ethanol/ 40% water)."
0	"To do it  we can heat the solution until obtains a mixture of two phases: one ethanol - rich liquid phase and one water-rich vapor phase  with the composition that is needed; then after have  removed the liquid phase  we cool down  the obtained vapor phase to bring it in liquid phase.Furthermore  if we draw a vertical line at the point corresponding to the composition of the initial solution  we can observe that there is no point in it which we can have a horizontal projection allowing to obtain a phase with 100 percent of ethanol. "
0	"The temperature range of the phase alpha of the solution of 60 percent ethanol is lower than the solution of 15 percent ethanol because the eutectic point is near.This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because there is an eutectic point for 95 percent ethanol."
0	"Due to the differences in boiling points between ethanol and water  a temperature can be applied to the 15% mixture that evaporates the ethanol  whilst being insufficient to evaporate the water (on the diagram  this temperature would be in the liquid+vapour region). The evaporated ethanol can then be siphoned off  with water added to it to reach the desired concentration. Not all the ethanol can be extracted this way though  as at around 95% ethanol the mixture goes straight from the combined liquid phase to a combined gaseous phase."

0	"ethanol vaporizes at 78.5C  so you can heat heat it up to this temperature and vaporize it completely and capture the ethanol (vapor) in a separate pot and cool it down and you have a pure composition of 100% ethanol.I assume that the system above which the phase diagram refers to is a closed system where no matter can escape. I think you can increase the volume of ethanol here from 15% to 60% by heating it up to about 71C because increasing temperature is proportional to larger volume. But you have to keep it at the new temperature then because otherwise the volume starts shrinking.It is impossible to reach 100% ethanol in the closed system because the ethanol requires therefore a temperature of 98C  and is no longer liquid  so you would have 2 phases: liquid water and ethanol vapor above it."
0	"Water mixture containing 15% ethanol has around 50% of ethanol in its vapor (can be found drawing a horizontal tieline on a diagram above)  so the solution would be to distill the initial solution to get liquid enriched in ethanol (50% now). The obtained liquid's vapor has about 60-70% ethanol. Therefore to get the desired result it is necessary to distill the solution the second time."
0	"From the diagram the top line on the left hand side is not marked as water or ethanol  but I assume it must be water as ethanol has a lower boiling point. If you boiled the mixture  the water part would only just be turning to gas  but there would be more of the ethanol as gas as that would have started getting enough energy to be a gas for a longer time - so the vapour coming off would be more ethanol - somehow you could catch that somewhere else  and end up with more ethanol in that mixture.You probably couldn't get 100% ethanol because as you got closer to the eutectic point  the mixture would boil off and the vapour would actually tend to be lower in ethanol than you wanted (or the same constant 95% or whatever it is)  and you couldn't get it any higher this way."
0	"An enriched solution could be obtained by vaporization of the solution. According to the phase diagram  a vapor with a higher fraction of ethanol would be obtained. Adjusting the time and the amount of vapour created (of which the fraction of ethanol is decreasing more and more) a gas of the composition need could be obtained. When this gas is cooled down completely  you would have the composition neded.The horizontal line cutting the 15 % vertical line at the point when the latter goes through the liquidus tells you the composition of the vapor: It's the composition where the horizontal goes through the vaporidus (or whatever it might be called :)). As you can see  this does not allow for concentration of 100 %. Neither does any liquid with lower concentration in ethanol that might by obtained during vaporizing the liquid."
0	"Tie line at 80 temperature   gives 15 to 65 (approx) percent ethanol range and for 60  % ethanol. Lever rule   gives vapor fraction = 0.9 and liquid fraction 0.1. At particular temperature (approx 65 ) there is direct vapor to liquid transformation that gives at about 95 % ethanol by distillation process. Further   again there is binary solution to reach 100. So it can not give 100 percent pure ethanol."
0	"As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapours. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapour and alcohol vapour. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapour content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapours to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.As a mixture with high vapour pressure has a low boiling point: a positive deviation from Raoult's law therefore we infer from the diagram that as the percentage of ethanol increases we see a lower vapour quantity and therefore lower vapour pressure. The molecules would not be able to boil off with the same ease and eventually the liquid and vapour curve would meet at 95.6% ethanol. If the mixture is re-distilled it would have the same concentration of ethanol."
0	"Distillation.  Ethanol has a lower vaporization temperature than water  so you slowly heat the liquid up.  The vapors will be a higher concentration of ethanol than water.  You use a condenser to collect the vapors and turn them back into a liquid.  This is how rum  whiskey  vodka and other hard liquors are made.  You can't go to 100% in one step  because the maximum ethanol content of the vapor is determined by the right boundary of the upper curve  which doesn't go to 100% for any temperature that has a liquid-vapor phase at 15% ethanol."

Thus  the solution will enrich to a composition of 60 percent ethanol-40 percent water  after cooling it. You cannot reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because there is an azeotrope. The maximum composition you can reach is the composition in the azeotrope."

If we'd continue from there in new boiling distillation process/es we could't reach a 100% of ethanol / 0% water  because there's a point in the diagram where the liquid and vapor curves meet (95 5% more or less?). Here the mixture has a constant boiling point (below pure ethanol boiling point) and the vapor and liquid compositions are the same in this point. So this looks like our limit in terms of obtaining pure ethanol  a 95 5% more or less."
0	"You would need to cool to below 80 degrees to around 70. this would increase amount of ethanol dissolved as a percentage.This moves the along the tie line to the right pushing up ethanol concentration.You can't get 100% pure as ethanol will move to pure liquid and seperate before then."
0	"Heat the 15% ethanol enough to get into the liquid and vapor region of the phase diagram. The composition of the vapor is given by the right side of the tie line at whatever temperature you are at  and that composition will be greater than 15%.  Physically separate the vapor from the liquid (with a pipe for example)  and then lower the temperature so it condenses.  You now have a liquid at a higher concentration of ethanol than before. Do it again  and the concentration will increase again. Continue until the concentration reaches 60 percent. You can continue this with diminishing returns as you move to the right in the L+V region of the phase diagram. The results diminish because the L+V portion of the phase diagram gets smaller and smaller  so it's hard to have a condition where you have a mix of vapor and liquid  which you need for this scheme to work.

0	"One starts with a liquid of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water.  One then increases the temperature. When the temperature reaches 80 degrees C (approximately)  one ends up reaching the bubble point curve  i.e. the boundary between the liquid region and the liquid + vapor region: the liquid starts to boil  and a vapor of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (approximately) is produced. This composition is obtained by drawing the tie line corresponding to the point where one intersects the bubble point curve (that is  the tie line corresponding to T = 80 degrees C). The vapor is thus enriched in ethanol. One then cools the vapor down so that it recondenses  producing a liquid (distillate) enriched in ethanol. This procedure can be repeated multiple times.Following this procedure  one notices that the liquid can be enriched in the component which has the lower boiling point - not the other way around: one goes down the lens-shaped diagram. The presence of the azeotrope in the ethanol-water phase diagram therefore explains why one cannot use this procedure to obtain a liquid of 100 percent ethanol. Even if one starts with a composition to the right of the azeotropic point  one would need to go up the little lens-shaped diagram  which is not possible.  "

0	"by heating the original mixture (15 percent ethanol and 85 percent water) up to 80 degree one gets a vapor of ethanol and water plus solution of water/ethanol  by cooling down the vapor to about 50 degree  we will get a solution composed of 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water. since the melting point of the ethanol is much lower than the one for water it is impossible to get 100 percent ethanol following the procedure. "
0	"To rectify ethanol we should vaporise it by elevating T above 80 degrees C. According to phase diagram and lever rule we can get some fracton of vapor containing higher fraction of ethanol or even tiny amount of vapor containing much higher fraction of ethanol. Then we could repeat this process  cooling vapor to T just above evaporation line and separating it from liquid.Howewer this process cannot go forever because at 95% ethanol concentration we have the same composition of liquid and vapor phases."
0	"First we have to heat the system and gather the vapor generated -which will have more ethanol than water-.Then we have to condense that vapor and heat it again and gather the second vapor to condense it and heat it again -far more ethanol than water-.That way we get a solution richer in ethanol.We can not get 100 percent ethanol  because at one point the nth vapor gathered will have the same composition as the solution from where it came  that is called an azeotrope. Meaning that the ethanol you want to purify boils at a slightly higher temperature than the azeotrope. "

When we reach eutectic point the composition remains the same then we heat it up and cool it down. "
0	"By cooling with a pressure constant."
0	"As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapours. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapour and alcohol vapour. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapour content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapours to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment."

0	"One could enrich the solution from 15% ethanol to 60% ethanol by cooling the mixture from the temperature where the liquidis matches the 15% composition to a temperature where the 60% composition meets the temperature of the liquidis at that composition and then distilling the liquid off at that temperature.One couldn't reach 100% composition of ethanol because between 90% and 100% there is a eutectic point where at that temperature the liquid sublimates directly to a vapor and no liquid could be distilled from that point."
0	"When the 15% ethanol is heated above 80 degrees the mixture will enter the vapor phase.  While in the vapor phase the water will more readily condense out than the ethanol yielding a vapor phase enriched in ethanol.  If held at about 80 degrees the ethanol will continue to be enriched to about 60%.  This vapor can be taken off and condensed to give a liquid that is 60% ethanol.  This enriching process can continue by distillation so long as the lens curve is going down.  Above about 95% the lens curve goes up so the vapor will be enriched in water in that part of the graph so further purifying of the ethanol cannot be accomplished."
0	"First increase temperature to above 100 degree to turn the solution in to vapor  then decrease the temperature of the vapor to around 85 degree  since at that temperature  the substance left in vapor would be the 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. We than collect those vapor and condense then to solution form.This procedure could not be used to reach 100 percent ethanol because at boiling point of 100 percent ethanol   not only 100 percent ethanol exists in vapor form  but also the 70 percent ethanol - 30 percent water."

Draw a line which will join the boiling curve at the right hand side (point C) and the vapor will condense to the liquid curve to get 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (point D  right below point C) at around 70~72 degree Celsius.This procedure cannot be employed to obtain pure ethanol as this require the mixture to have a zero partial pressure.

You can repeat the process and you will again have a higher percent ethanol.  Effectively you would repeatedly cool and separate the liquid and vapor  with each iteration having a higher percent ethanol vapor and higher percent water liquid.You could not reach 100 percent ethanol because the eutectic point is below 100 percent.  At that point  when you precipitate out the liquid it will have the same percent ethanol as the vapor.  You are effectively stuck it seems."
0	"Using the fractional distillation procedure under standard ambient temperature and pressure (25C and 1 atm)  by elevating the temperature of the system water-ethanol  you'd constantly vaporize and condensate the components until you get a solution that shows a composition of higher concentration of ethanol than the original solution. That happens because the vapor condensed in the distillation column has a higher concentration of ethanol (since it has the smaller boiling point). It's not possible to reach a composition of 100% ethanol this way because once you achieve the azeotrope composition  both components will behave as a one component solution  and the distillation will proceed at a constant temperature  so  the composition won't change. Though  it's possible to remove the remaining water by adding benzen and removing two azeotropes  first benzen-water-ethanol (bp 65C)  then ethanol-benzen (bp 68C). The result material will be pure ethanol. "
0	"One could enrich a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water by heating the solution to the upper end of the boiling range at the desired fraction ethanol (about 82 degrees in this case). The solution will boil  yielding a vapour of the desired composition and leaving some residual water-enriched liquid  which can be discarded. The vapour can be made into a liquid solution of the desired composition by cooling the vapour below the lower end of the boiling range at that composition.The solution can be enriched further by repeating the same general distillation process: Heat the solution to the temperature of the upper end of the boiling range at the desired composition  collect the vapour  and recondense. However  this technique cannot be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol: The phase diagram has a eutectic  and the distillation process can only enrich a solution to this point (about 96 percent ethanol). This is because when heating a solution whose ethanol fraction is higher than that at the eutectic  the vapour will be enriched in water rather than ethanol relative to the original composition. (At the eutectic itself  there is a single boiling point rather than a range  so the vapour will have the identical composition to the original solution.)"

0	"According to the phase diagram  water and ethanol are miscible liquids. If the solution is currently at room temperature  heating it would cause the apparition of two different phases: a liquid phase  with a higher water molar fraction as temperature increases  and a vapor phase  with also a water molar fraction higher as T increases.Also  as temperature increases  the relative percentage of the liquid phase decreases as the relative percentage of the vapor phase increases  following the equilibrium lines that conform the phase diagram.At a certain temperature  the relative percentage of these two phases would reach X% liquid phase and (100-X)% vapor phase; if then we draw an isotherm of this temperature  this line would cut the phase diagram eqilibrium lines: these cut-points represent the composition of each phase (liquid and vapor) coexisting at that temperature.The solution we want would be the liquid phase at this temperature (which would coexist with a vapor phase)  with a composition of 40%water and 60% ethanol.To simply find this temperature  select a 60%ethanol 40%water composition and draw a vertical line (isopleth) in the phase diaram. The point at which this vertical line cuts the equilibrium line separating the vapor and liquid+vapor fields  marks the temperature that is needed to create a solution with the wanted composition.As the phase diagram shows  there are two vapor+liquid fields; the left field generates liquid phases ethanol-enriched  as T increases  but the right one generates water-enriched solutions; it means that the best ethanol-enriched solution would reach an ethanol molar fraction of 95% (aproximately) which is the composition corresponding to the liquid-vapor congruency point."

After the system reaches equilibrium  there will be vapor and liquid (with composition equal to where the horizontal line crosses the liquidus line). Remove the liquid  and cool the vapor.

On the other hand  if presented with a solution with ethanol concentration greater than that at which the leaves join  one could repeatedly heat the solution  aspirate the vapor   heat the reserved solution  and so on  and come very close to 100%  but not actually reach it.

0	"One starts with a liquid of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water. As the temperature is increased  one ends up reaching the bubble point curve  i.e. the boundary between the liquid region and the liquid + vapor region: the liquid starts to boil  and a vapor of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (approximately) is produced. This composition is obtained by drawing the tie line corresponding to the point where one intersects the bubble point curve. The vapor is thus enriched in ethanol. One then cools the vapor down so that it recondenses  producing a liquid (distillate) enriched in ethanol. This procedure can be repeated multiple times.Following this procedure  one notices that the liquid can be enriched in the component which has the lower boiling point - not the other way around: one goes down the lens-shaped diagram. The presence of the eutectic in the ethanol-water phase diagram therefore explains why one cannot use this procedure to obtain a liquid of 100 percent ethanol. Even if one starts with a composition to the right of the eutectic point  one would need to go up the little lens-shaped diagram  which is not possible.  "

0	"You have to start by rapidly raising the temperature above 100 C and boiling both of them away.   As the fraction of ethanol increases  the water will boil away at lower temperatures.  At the point where water is boiling away at 80 C  you will have the composition of elements you need.  You cannot reach 100% ethanol this way  because ethanol actually has a lower boiling point than water  so you cannot boil all of the water away."

According to the phase diagram that vapor will have about 60% ethanol at that temperature. If we take the vapor out and cool it down somewhere else we'll have the liquid solution of the required ethanol-water composition.We can't make 100% ethanol because at the boiling start temperature we get the vapor with only ~65% ethanol. And the concentration gets down if we heat up higher."

If the vapor phase is separated from the system  cooled and condensated  then a new mixture  richer in ethanol  will be generated.A pure 100% ethanol composition can not be reached because there is an eutectic composition for which boiling the mixture leads to a vapor with no specific component enrichment. Furthermore  if the mixture is richer in ethanol than this limit composition  the vapor will be enriched in water. "
0	"1. The mixtures of liquids whose intermolecular interactions are widely different do not behave ideally  and may be impossible to separate by ordinary distillation. The reason for this is that under certain conditions  the compositions of the liquid and of the vapour in equilibrium with it become identical  precluding any further separation. 2.The  Azeotropic distillation is used  in dehydrating ethanol and water mixtures. Azeotrope  such as benzene  pentane  cyclohexane  hexane  heptane  isooctane  acetone  and diethyl ether are  used  as the mixture option.3. one could enrich a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water by using Azeotropic distillation.4.But this procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol.

Ethanol- water forms a MInimum Boiling Azeotrope and the mixture will have maximum vapour pressure. Ethanol starts distilling out first   but once an azeotrope is formed between ethanol and water  it is not possible to separate them by distillation.  The azeotropic mixture behaves like a single substance. So  continuous distillation from 15% ethanol -85% water composition till the mixture attains  azeotropic composition  will ensure enrichment of ethanol in the sample.

0	"Enter response here.Distillation is a separation process for a mixture of liquids or oils. In this case the ethanol-water mixture to be separated is added to a distilling pot where it is heated to the boiling point of each component. Lower boiling component(ethanol) will preferentially vaporize first. This vapor passes into a distilling head and then into a condenser. Within the condenser the vapor is cooled and it liquefies. The resulting liquid is then collected in a receiving flask. So starting with a 15% ethanol - 85% water composition the ethanol distills first and is collected thereby increasing the concentration of the mixture to about 60% ethanol-40% water composition  as the water distills after the ethanol it can be regulated to get the appropriate composition.Furthermore  this procedure cannot be used to get a purity of 100% ethanol because the distillation vapor will be a mixture enriched in the lower boiling component(ethanol)  but still containing some of the higher boiling component(water). As the distillation proceeds  the liquid in the distilling pot will have a greater  and greater percentage of higher boiling component(water) if not stopped."
0	"I would use distillation. Warm the mixture of alcohol and water to convert the liquid to a vapor primarily consisting of alcohol. This happens because alcohol has a lower boiling point than water. The alcohol is collected by condensation through a cold condenser above the heated liquid. Collection should be stopped before the temperature of the reaches the boiling point of water. I would stop at 85 or 90 degrees C based on the diagram above.Water and ethanol interact through hydrogen bonding to produce and azeotrope (the small  bounded region) which has a lower boiling point than a simple mixture of alcohol and water in which there is no interaction.

A solution could be obtained by extracting the vapor and letting it cool back to the liquid phase. The concentration of the resulting solution would depend on the actual curves in the phase diagram. In this case  for a solution with 15% ethanol  the tie line indicates that vapor with approximately 65% ethanol will be released at the beginning of boiling.By repeating this process  solutions with increased concentrations of ethanol can be obtained.

If the temperature is kept just at the point where vaporization begins  the ethanol content of the vapor will be right around 60%.If the solution is not heated to that temperature  no vaporization will occur; and if it is heated to a higher temperature  the ethanol content of the vapor will be lower.  Therefore 60% is about the best ethanol content that can be achieved through this process."
0	"1. Start by heating the 15% Ethanol solution to slightly above 80 degrees2. Now  if we wait some time  the water will slowly begin to evaporate out and become vapor  which will increase the percent ethanol3. A similar procedure can be used by adjusting the temperature to in the region between the liquid and vapor equilibrium lines... but it will gradually become less effective as the solution becomes more concentrated with ethanol when the eutectic point grows closer (at about 95% ethanol). Eventually  after the solution grows more concentrated than about 95% ethanol  the water will no longer evaporate out of solution  only the ethanol will begin to evaporate out... which would lower the concentration of ethanol.

0	"I see various possibilities:1. Add  liquid ethanol to the inicial solution at low temperature (<70C: all liquid). 100% ethanol isnt possible because this method doesnt remove the water.2. Cool the hot inicial vapor solution (>100C) down; it forms liquid water with elevated fraction of ethanol into the vapor. Filter the liquid water out. The vapor composition moves to the right in the diagram. With the appropriate temperature its is possible to reach at 95% ethanol in the vapor (at the eutectic point)."

Withdraw newly formed vapor and condense.If this process is repeated  (e.g. starting with 60/40 liquid)  it will boil at somewhat lower temp  and produce higher EtOH fraction.  But process will end at intersection of two phase groups (approx 96% EtOH.)  Any vapor produced from boiling at this point will have same concentration as liquid- so no further separation is possible."

0	"The solution could  be heated causing the liquid to form into a mixture of liquid and vapor and then into only vapor.  Then it could be cooled.  As it cools the liquid that is formed will be richer in ethanol than it is water causing the composition to change (disproportionation).  Once the ethanol composition is approximately 95% the vapor and liquid are in equilibrium.  Evaporation occurs without a change in composition.  At this point there are zero degrees of freedom and further distillation is not possible."
0	"Heat the solution until vapour forms. At this point we have a vapour mixutre of water and ethanol.

0	"A solution of 15% ethanol and 85% water can be enriched up to 60% ethanol and 40% water by distillation of the ethanol out of the ethanol-water mixture. Because water boils at 100C and ethanol at 78C  at the lower boiling point the ethanol will vaporize and can be condensed by cooling. But the mixture also has a lower boiling point than water so the ethanol will not be pure. This can be further enriched by repeating the distillation process. The point where the mixture becomes an azeotrope  which means that the 2 components will boil at the same temperature and so cannot be separated further  is indicated by the low point where the 2 curves meet on the graph at about 95% ethanol and 5% water.Researched at Wikipedia"

We can then collect the gas  or remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.Because it's very difficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.  In addition  the eutectic point forbid us to collect vapor with a higher concentration of ethanol past a certain point."

So  by heating the mixture  the most volatile component will concentrate to a greater degree in the vapor leaving the liquidSince ethanol evaporates faster than water  the ethanol rises through a tube  collects and condenses into another container. The water is left behind.At the concentration of 95% ethanol  water and ethanol form what is known as an azeotrope. This is a mixture in which the azeotrope distills off before the desired liquie (ethanol). Citing from my memory  ethanol boils at 78.3C and the azeotrope of 95% ethanol/water boils off at 78.15C. So you really neevr can get 100% ethanol from distillation because the azeotrope has a lower boiling poinT"
0	"-The solution can be enrich through the process of distillation: it relies on differences in the boiling points of the component liquids to be separated. The mixture to be separated is added to a Distilling Pot where it is heated to the boiling point. The Lower boiling component (ethanol)  will preferentially vaporize first. This vapor passes into a Distilling Head and then into a Condenser. Within the Condenser the vapor is cooled and it liquifies  if you can change the variation of vapor concentration  you can get the desired composition. -The reason because could not be to reach a completely pure composition is that the lower boiling component distills off first and can be collected. A downside of simple distillation is that the purity of the distillate is rarely 100%. This is because the distillation vapor is only enriched in the lower boiling component. Some of the higher boiling component will be present as well."

0	"In a closed container heat up the 15%-ethanol solution enough so that we move up from the region of liquid to the region of liquid + vapor. The composition of the vapor is given by moving to the right along a tie-line; it will be richer in ethanol. Remove the now ethanol-poor liquid and cool the vapor to get a liquid with a higher percentage of ethanol. It so happens that there is a tie-line connecting a little less than 15% to 60%  so we could heat to a minimum temperature and in one step get a very small amount of 60% solution. But in general we can't expect to do this. We would heat to a higher temperature and obtain sub-60% ethanol liquid and then repeat the procedure. This procedure lives  so to speak  in the liquid + vapor lens that is to the left of the minimum point of the bounding curves at 95% ethanol. So we can never get 100% ethanol."

Starting with a mixture of 15%ethanol - 85% water and by simple distillation we can condense the mixture to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water because at the beginning of the distillation the distillate will be water. b) The main characteristic of this mixture is that it s composition is unchanged by distillation when it reaches the minimum boiling point and in this case at approximately 78oC and has a concentration of approximately 95% ethanol and 5% water. Thus  it will continue to boil and produce vapors with constant composition (95% ethanol and 5% water)"

0	"We can read off the phase diagram that as we heat a solution of water and 15% ethanol  the liquid will separate into ethanol-rich vapor and water-rich liquid - disproportionation. As we increase the temperature  more of the water will vaporize as well  and eventually the whole solution will vaporize. So in order to vaporize more ethanol and less water  the temperature has to be just right.We want a composition of 60% ethanol and 40% water. When the solution is heated to a little over 80 degrees  the vapor yields precisely that composition. So if we heat the solution to that temperature  gather  the vapor  then separate the vapor from the liquid and let the vapor cool  we will have the solution we were looking for.This procedure could not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 % ethanol  however. Because  as we can see on the phase diagram  any solution of water and ethanol with less than ~95% ethanol  will not yield vapor with more than ~95% ethanol at any temperature. If the original composition is only 15% ethanol  the moment any vapor begins to form it is not of much more than 60% ethanol composition - and any higher temperature will yield less ethanol - so it's impossible to get pure ethanol."

0	"You have to start by rapidly raising the temperature above 100 C and boiling both of them away.   As the fraction of ethanol increases  the water will boil away at lower temperatures.  At the point where water is boiling away at 80 C  you will have the composition of elements you need.  You cannot reach 100% ethanol this way  because ethanol actually has a lower boiling point than water  so you cannot boil all of the water away.  I have thought about the question a little more and want to add that you can probably boil it at 80 C all along  because of the initial concentration of ethanol.  I think the Lever Rule could be used for a definite quantitative answer.  Sorry  I really need to sleep on all these questions!"

'cos our fluid water & vapour ethanol zone finishes before we get to pure ethanol: meaning that at near 100%ethanol (the Eutectic point) our vapour contains water - the two substances do not exist separately in distinct phases at a single temperature."
0	"The enrichment is achieved by heating the solution to a temperature above the liquidus. Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. This resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%. Additionally  at a concentration of ~95% ethanol  the phase diagram shows an eutectic  meaning both components transition to vapor at the same temperature point. Hence  no further gains in concentration are possible beyond ~95%."
0	"For that purpose one should heat the solution up to 90C getting a solution enriched to a 40% of ethanol  this process is called distillation.To enrich the solution with more ethanol it is necessary to do another distillation  this one at 80C getting a solution with a 60% of ethanol on it. This process cannot be used to get pure composition of ethanol because the maximun amount of ethanol that can be reached is approximately 95%."
0	"Boiling point of pure ethanol is 78.5 C whereas pure water has a boiling point of 100 C. Since water and ethanol forms azeotrop  the components of the mixture boils together. Notably  the fraction of these components are different from each other since their boiling points differ from each other. As pure ethanol boils at a lower temperature  the fraction of ethanol in the vapor phase higher than that of water. If one heats a solution of 60 percent ethanol-40 percent water (the boling point of the mixture is around 70 C)  the temperature of the mixture increases during the boiling process. Eventually  the liquid phase is enriched by water and when the temperature reaches around 80 C  the liquid phase contains 85 percent water to 15 percent ethanol."

The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.Because it's very dufficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol."
0	"Heating the system above the particular temperature from which the solution boils (a little below 80C for 15% ethanol) will create a vapor phase with a certain composition of ethanol and water coexisting with the liquid phase.Although the system overall still has the same composition  the vapor should have a higher concentration of ethanol than the liquid  which is given by the cut between a T=constant line and the vapor-vapor+liquid transition line. Reaching an appropriate temperature (slightly above 80C) would yield a vapor with a 60% ethanol concentration.By leading this vapor to another section of the system  and cooling it there  the enriched liquid would then condensate.This procedure cannot be used to reach a solution which has a concentration higher than around 95% ethanol  since an eutectic point can be found at such an ethanol molar fraction. As the procedure were repeated over and over  drawing closer to the eutectic point  the vapor phase would not eventually have a significantly higher ethanol concentration than the liquid (in mathematical terms  at the eutectic point it would not even be infinitesimally higher!)."
0	" At the composition where the upper curve showing vapour phase meets the lower curve  liquid and vapour phases will have same composition. At this point at constant temperature the mixture will distil over completely without any change in its composition or as an Azeotropic mixture till  about 96% by mass of ethanol and water ). Ethanol- water forms a MInimum Boiling Azeotrope and the mixture will have maximum vapour pressure. Ethanol starts distilling out first   but once an azeotrope is formed between ethanol and water  it is not possible to separate them by distillation.  The azeotropic mixture behaves like a single substance. So  continuous distillation from 15% ethanol -85% water composition till the mixture attains  azeotropic composition  will ensure enrichment of ethanol in the sample. Hence 60-40 mixture distillation pose no problem. But separation of  the azeotrope need sophisticated techniques employing drying  adsorption etc"

At equilibrium at the proper temperature  the vapor phase could be composed of 60% ethanol/40% water.

At the eutectic composition  the water and ethanol would both boil  making further purification by distillation impossible."
0	"I would use distillation  which is a process used to enrich a mix of two or more liquids with different boiling points. This process consists of heating the mix and then the compound with the lower boiling point will evaporate  separating it from the mix. Using this  you will get a vapor rich in ethanol and a liquid rich in water.Distillation can not be used to reach a pure composition of 100% ethanol because the mix forms an azeotrope at 96% ethanol (maximum composition of ethanol you can obtain). At this point  the mix behaves like only one component with a boiling point that is lower than that of either component  so you can not separate them. In addition  you can not reach an efficiency of 100% in the process."

That is because water and ethanol form a solution called azeotrope.The azeotropes are solution of two or more components  whose proportions are such that the vapor produced by partial evaporation has the same composition as the liquid.

The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.Because it's very difficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol.  In addition  the euctic point forbid us to collect vapor with a higher concentration of ethanol past a certain point."
0	"As the mixture is azeotropic  therefore the boiling point is 78.2C which is lower than ethanol and water. As ethanol has dispersion forces which are weaker than the water polar attractive forces  therefore ethanol molecules are more likely to break off and become vapors. Therefore as the temperature is increased  more alcohol molecules would boil off and distill. As the process continues  we note that at 60% ethanol and a temperature of 78.5  the contents are a mixture of water vapor and alcohol vapor. One would move from the liquid phase to more and more vapor content to enrich from 15% to 60% ethanol. We are interested in vapors to boil off and collect for distillation and enrichment.As a mixture with high vapor pressure has a low boiling point: a positive deviation from Raoult's law therefore we infer from the diagram that as the percentage of ethanol increases we see a lower vapor quantity and therefore lower vapor pressure. The molecules would not be able to boil off with the same ease and eventually the liquid and vapor curve would meet at 95.6% ethanol.

Collect this vapor in a condenser leading to a flask. However  this process cannot make 100% ethanol because at any temperature around ethanol's boiling point  the vapor produced will have the ethanol vapor + water. "
0	"Heating up the solution at about 80C   I can have a fraction of vapour whose composition is 60% of ethanol. cooling down that vapour i obtain the enrichment.Please note that because the boiling point of a 15% ethanol solution seems to be 80C and at that temperature we intercept the vapour phase line at a concentraton of 60% ethanol  the amount of vapour produced is very very little  I can have more vapour by increasing temperature  but i will have lower percentage of ethanol"
0	"A solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water can be enriched to a composition of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water by distillation. Distillation is the method of separating mixtures based on differences in volatility of its components in the vapor - liquid region of the phase diagram. The distillation of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water results in a distillate richer in ethanol than water.To obtain a distillate of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water  the distillation may be done in one or two steps.Distillation can not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100 percent ethanol because of the existence of a positive azeotrope in the ethanol-water phase diagram. An azeotrope is a mixture of two or more liquids in such a way that its components cannot be altered by simple distillation. This is because when an azeotrope is boiled  the vapor it produces has proportionate constituents as the original mixture. Azeotropes are constant boiling mixtures."
0	"Well  it's a typical industrial application I think.If you have the liquid at 15% of Ethanol (x = 0 15) in the dew point you could reach a vapor with high purity (more than 60%)  so we could reach the necessity only heating until the dew point  but it's too slow  so if you heat until 82C and maintain the equilibrium there you could produce a vapor with the desire composition that you could condensate after that  and a liquid with approximate x = 0 12 ethanol.You can't reach the 100 % purity because if you reach the minimum point the vapor and the liquid will have the same composition always. This point is in x = 0 94 approx. It's an azeotrope."

0	"Due to the differences in boiling points between ethanol and water  a temperature can be applied to the 15% mixture that evaporates the ethanol  whilst being insufficient to evaporate the water (on the diagram  this temperature would be in the liquid+vapour region). The evaporated ethanol can then be siphoned off  with water added to it to reach the desired concentration. Some water will still be present in the extracted and condensed vapour though  so this procedure must be carried out many times at lower and lower temperatures to continue to improve the yield. The % can not exceed that of the Eutectic composition (around 95%)  as the combined liquid goes straight to the gaseous phase at this point."

In result of rectification we can obtain solution of 95.6% ethanol and 4% of water. Becaus this solution like one liquid  not like mixture. And we can observ it in diagram. Boiling point of this solution is 70 degrees. And becaus of fact that EtOH and water can make such solution it is impossible rech 100 EtOH by vaporisation."

As the new vapor phase (with new composition) is separated from the liquid  it can be cooled down to get vapor of higher ethanol purity. The process is repeated until a pure enough ethanol is produced. However  as ethanol purity reaches a certain level  the water-ethanol will form azeotroph.

The ethanol and water composition in the vapor phase will be different from that in the liquid phase.  The vapor phase will have a higher concentration of ethanol  due to its lower boiling point compared to water (78.5 C vs 100 C).  Collect the vapor phase and cool it to to condense all of the vapor.

0	"On the plot  the position of the 60% ethanol is below the 15% ethanol One way of acheiving this is by reducing the temperature(or pressure) of the system(solution). By doing this will increase the solubility of ethanol in the solution and hence increase its concentration from 15% to 60%.This method will not be feasible in producing 100% pure ethanol since for this to occur  the partial pressure of ethanol in water must equate to the athmospheric pressure which is very hard to acheive."
0	"At the initial solution concentration  as you increase the temperature to approximately 80 degrees  the ethanol begins to vaporize while the water stays in the liquid state.  You could then remove a proportion of the liquid while simultaneously reducing temperature to approximately 70 degrees to reach the 60 percent ethanol composition.At an ethanol composition above approximately 96-97% raising the temperature begins to produce liquid ethanol and water vapor (the area represented by the curves at the far right).  An alternative method would be required to extract this additional water."
0	"To enrich a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water up to 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water  one could use the difference of vapour pressure of the two substances. A method of doing so is by elevating the temperature up to the point in which almost all ethanol is vaporized. Then  the ethanol gas should be separeted from the mixture  causing the temperature to drop  and  due to its vapour pressure  more ethanol to vaporize. The ethanol should be once more separeted from the mixture. This procedure could be followed until the desired point (60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water) is reached.Unfortunatelly  this procedure can't be followed to reach 100 percent ethanol composition because the diagram shows an azeotropic point  close to a 95 percent ethanol - 5 percent water composition. When this point is reached  just increasing the temperature won't change the composition because both substances boil equally. Also  at that point  the composition of the vapour is the same as the liquid"

0	"A water-ethanol solution with 15% ethanol at ~80 degrees C (or slightly more) will have liquid water and vaporous ethanol  since 90 degrees is past the boiling point of water  100 degrees C  and not past the boiling point of ethanol  78.5 degrees C. You can take out the liquid water easily. This could make the solution 60% ethanol. However  it couldn't make it 100% ethanol because the phase diagram shows that once the solution goes past a certain concentration of ethanol  water won't condense anymore. If you lower the temperature to let the water condense  then the ethanol will also condense. Therefore  the process can only enrich the solution to a point  and can't completely remove the water."

0	"Using the fractional distillation procedure  by elevating the temperature of the system water-ethanol  one would vaporize and then condensate the components resulting in a solution that shows a composition of higher concentration of ethanol than the original solution. That happens because the vapor condensed in the distillation column has a higher concentration of ethanol (since it has the smaller boiling point). It's not possible to reach a composition of one hundred percent ethanol this way because once you achieve the azeotropic composition  both components will behave as a one component solution  and the distillation will proceed at a constant temperature  so  the composition won't change. On the other hand  it is possible to remove the remaining water by adding benzen and removing two azeotropes  first benzene-water-ethanol   then ethanol-benzene. The result material will be pure ethanol. "
0	"I think we have to add a precise quantity of  ethanole at a temperature less than the melting point for not loose ethanole as a vapor. But this procedure couldn't be used to reach a pure composition of ethanole because for eliminate all the water we need to vaporize it  boiling the solution at 100 degrees  but doing so we will loose ethanole too.

Continuing this process will result in an enrichment of water in the liquid solution and a consequent increasing of the boiling point. The collected vapor will therefore decrease in ethanol content. When the vapor is the same % of ethanol below 60% as the initial vapor composition was above  stop collecting the condensate.To make the process continuous  a solution of 60% ethanol water could be added to the boiling solution at the same rate as condensate is collected. This would maintain the solution composition  the original  boiling point  and therefore the same ethanol vapor composition. But if the goal is to produce a 60% ethanol solution  this would be obviously be rather a waste of time  as a 60% solution one would have to be available.In reality  a fractional distillation would be preferable so that 96% ethanol could be obtained  and then diluted down accordingly with water to produce the desired solution."

Specifically  for the desired 60:40 split  we can see from the vaporization line in the phase diagram that a temperature a little bit above 80 C would be optimal. This resulting vapor will contain Ethanol at ~60%. The vapor then needs to be conducted out and cooled down to turn it back into a liquid maintaining the concentration from the vapor.From the phase diagram  it follows that vaporization sets in below the vaporization point of pure ethanol. This implies that the resulting vapor contains something else than pure ethanol which must be water. Hence  the procedure cannot be used to purify the ethanol to 100%. Additionally  at a concentration of 95% ethanol  the phase diagram shows an eutectic  meaning both components transition to vapor at that point. Hence  no further gains in concentration are possible."
0	"The ethanol-water phase diagram given here is of the minimum boiling  positive azeotropic mixture. The azeotropic mixtures on distillation of give the component near to the azeotropic point. The given phase diagram represents a 15% ethanol and 85% water system. The method to increase the proportion of ethanol in the system is lowering the temperature. On lowering the temperature  the system moves more towards the azeotropic boiling poing and produces more vapors of ethanol. Another way to improve the purity of ethanol is continuous distillation and on each time  we get purer form of ethanol which is near to the azeotrop. The addition of extra quantity of ethanol to the system can somehow produce ethanol level higher than that of the azeotropic poing but with purity less than that of the original concentration. The addition of a third component like benzene can favour the production of ethanol to high purity up to 99.5%.It is the important property of azeotrop that the purity of either component cannot be raised  above the azeotropic point  therefore we cannot obtain 100% ethanol from an azeotropic mixture of ethanol-water system"

The distillation temperature needs to be below the bottom boundary of the vapor phase and above the upper boundary of the liquid phase; referring to the phase diagram the horizontal line representing the appropriate temperature should intercept the vapor line where that line intercepts the vertical line for a 40/60 water/ethanol mix - i.e.  roughly 82 degrees C.  If the vapor mix is then drawn off and cooled to a point where it enters the liquid phase of the diagram  a condensate with the desired 40/60 mix should result.To further increase the proportion of ethanol  it is necessary to move further to the right on the phase diagram  which (due to the downward slope of the vapor line) means that the distillation temperature must be reduced.  However  from the diagram the lowest usable temperature will only produce an ethanol concentration of about 95% - reducing the temperature further will keep the mixture entirely within the liquid phase  rendering distillation impossible."

When the temperature reaches 80C (approximately)  one ends up reaching the bubble point curve  i.e. the boundary between the liquid region and the liquid + vapor region: the liquid starts to boil  and a vapor of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (approximately) is produced. This composition is obtained by drawing the tie line corresponding to the point where one intersects the bubble point curve (that is  the tie line corresponding to T = 80C). The vapor is thus enriched in ethanol. One then cools the vapor down so that it recondenses  producing a liquid (distillate) enriched in ethanol. This procedure can be repeated multiple times.Following this procedure  one notices that the liquid can be enriched in the component which has the lower boiling point - not the other way around: one goes down the lens-shaped diagram. The presence of the azeotrope in the ethanol-water phase diagram therefore explains why one cannot use this procedure to obtain a liquid of 100 percent ethanol. Even if one starts with a composition to the right of the azeotropic point  one would need to go up the little lens-shaped diagram  which is not possible.  "
