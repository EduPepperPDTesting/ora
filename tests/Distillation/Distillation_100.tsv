We can then collect the gas  or remove the water  and let the vapor cool since the vapor phase at that temperature has a higher concentration of ethanol.  The resulting solution should be higher in ethanol.Because it's very dufficult to separate water vapor and ethanol vapor  this method will never result in 100% ethanol."
0	"We should heat up the solution up to about 83 C. At that temperature we'll have some small percent of the liquid gone into vapor. According to the phase diagram that vapor will have about 60% ethanol at that temperature. If we take the vapor out and cool it down somewhere else we'll have the liquid solution of the required ethanol-water composition.We can't make 100% ethanol using this procedure because after we've got 95% ethanol solution there'll be no increase in it's concentration in the vapor."

0	"To enrich a solution of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water up to 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water  one could use the difference of vapour pressure of the two substances. A method of doing so is by elevating the temperature up to the point in which almost all ethanol is vaporized. Then  the ethanol gas should be separeted from the mixture  causing the temperature to drop  and  due to its vapour pressure  more ethanol to vaporize. The ethanol should be once more separeted from the mixture. This procedure could be followed until the desired point (60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water) is reached.Unfortunatelly  this procedure can't be followed to reach 100 percent ethanol composition because the diagram shows an azeotropic point  close to a 95 percent ethanol - 5 percent water composition. When this point is reached  just increasing the temperature won't change the composition because both substances boil equally. Also  at that point  the composition of the vapour is the same as the liquid"

0	"An azeotrope is a liquid mixture of two or more components having a unique constant boiling point and fixed  and that passing into the vapor state behaves as a pure compound  or as if it were a single component. To get a purer compound will need to use special resources such as azeotropic distillation. For example  if subjected to a simple distillation a mixture of 50% ethanol 50% evaporating the mixture obtained two products: pure water in background (~ 25% ethanol)  and a distillate with a higher ethanol concentration (~ 74%). If this mixture is distilled again a 2nd distillate obtained with an ethanol concentration of about 82%. A 3 rd distillation distillate will throw an ~ 87% ethanol. As shown in the figure  successive distillations to approximate the distillate composition of the azeotrope (95% ethanol)  but never pure ethanol."
0	"One could bring the solution to about the condensation temperature range  between 80 degrees and 100 degrees  and then proceed to add ethanol to the mix until the desired fraction is reached  always keeping the temperature of the mixture in the condensation range  then bring the temperature back down until the solution is liquid again. This cannot bring the solution 100% ethanol  due to the eutectic occurring in the middle of the diagram  as soon as the composition reaches this eutectic it will either fall into the liquid or vapor area  and will not be able to incorporate any more ethanol into the solution."
0	"Well  it's a typical industrial application I think.If you have the liquid at 15% of Ethanol (x = 0 15) in the dew point you could reach a vapor with high purity (more than 60%)  so we could reach the necessity only heating until the dew point  but it's too slow  so if you heat until 82C and maintain the equilibrium there you could produce a vapor with the desire composition that you could condensate after that  and a liquid with approximate x = 0 12 ethanol.You can't reach the 100 % purity because if you reach the minimum point the vapor and the liquid will have the same composition always. This point is in x = 0 94 approx. It's an azeotrope."

0	"Temperature should be elevated . There will be an equilibrium of liquid and vapor.Vapor should be cooled and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution. If the distillation resulted in lower ethanol content in the collected solution  distillation should be repeated from the enriched solution until we get the appropriate composition."
0	"We can enrich the solution by distilling it and recover the distillate. When we boil that solution  the vapor contains both ethanol and water. Based on the phase diagram  we can have a one-step distillation to achieve an approximate of 60:40 ethanol water solution  that is  the distillate we could recover.Further distillation steps for each distillate concentrates the ethanol solution. However  we cannot attain 100 percent ethanol if we use ethanol-water solution. Further purification processes will attain the ultimate distillate  an approximately 97% ethanol solution. The 97% ethanol solution is already an azeotrope. Further distillation for this will only acquire vapor that has the same composition with the liquid counterpart."
0	"By increasing the temperature you could increase the volume of the ethanol faster than the water  and thus you are able to get a 60:40 percent concentration. However  no matter how much you heat it  there will still be some water in the ethanol and it will never be pure"
0	"Ethanol evaporates at a lower temperature than water. Through a destillation process  you could separate the phases  thus allowing to obtain an enriched mixture of water and ethanol. However  100% ethanol can not be ontained because through heat  water molecules dissipate in air  therefore some water would go along with the ethanol."
0	"We follow the regular distillation procedure heating the mixture to increase the percent of water and decrease the percent of ethanol in the liquid phase while the opposite happens in the vapor. We continue until we reach 60% in the vapor what means around 80C in the thermometer place in the vapor. We could continue enrichment until we get the eutectic point. There there is difference between the liquid and vapor composition so i does not matter how long we keep our distillation going  we cannot go farther the 95% of eutectic point."
0	"When the solution of 15 percent ethanol-85 percent water is heated (named point A) until around 77~79 degree  it will hit the boiling curve right above point A (named B)  whereby the vapor composition is 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water. Draw a line which will join the boiling curve at the right hand side (point C) and the vapor will condense to the liquid curve to get 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (point D  right below point C) at around 70~72 degree Celsius.This procedure cannot be employed to obtain pure ethanol as this require the mixture to have a zero partial pressure. "
0	"The initial solution could be heated to a temperature as determined by the phase diagram to a specific temperature in the liquid/vapor region of the phase diagram. At equilibrium at the proper temperature  the vapor phase could be composed of 60% ethanol/40% water. Gathering the vapor and cooling back to liquid would yield a liquid solution of the desired composition.A pure composition could not be achieved because of the eutectic point on the phase diagram. The equilibrium boiling point of progressively enriched liquids gathered from the vapor would continually decrease as the composition approached the eutectic. At the eutectic composition  the water and ethanol would both boil  making further purification by distillation impossible."

0	"Tie line at 80 temperature   gives 15 to 65 (approx) percent ethanol range and for 60  % ethanol. Lever rule   gives vapor fraction = 0.9 and liquid fraction 0.1. At particular temperature (approx 65 ) there is direct vapor to liquid transformation that gives at about 95 % ethanol by distillation process. Further   again there is binary solution to reach 100. So it can not give 100 percent pure ethanol."

So in order to enrich the initial solution  we could increase the temperature of the initial solution to approximately 80C  then extract the vapor that we produced because at that temperature the final solution exists in two phases (liquid + vapor) so we're able to begin the decrease of the temperature of the vapor we obtained before at a final temperature below at 78C  in order to obtain the solution  in the liquid state  that we need (60% ethanol/ 40% water)."

0	"One starts with a liquid of 15 percent ethanol - 85 percent water. As the temperature is increased  one ends up reaching the bubble point curve  i.e. the boundary between the liquid region and the liquid + vapor region: the liquid starts to boil  and a vapor of 60 percent ethanol - 40 percent water (approximately) is produced. This composition is obtained by drawing the tie line corresponding to the point where one intersects the bubble point curve. The vapor is thus enriched in ethanol. One then cools the vapor down so that it recondenses  producing a liquid (distillate) enriched in ethanol. This procedure can be repeated multiple times.Following this procedure  one notices that the liquid can be enriched in the component which has the lower boiling point - not the other way around: one goes down the lens-shaped diagram. The presence of the eutectic in the ethanol-water phase diagram therefore explains why one cannot use this procedure to obtain a liquid of 100 percent ethanol. Even if one starts with a composition to the right of the eutectic point  one would need to go up the little lens-shaped diagram  which is not possible.  "
0	"     By heating the 15%E/85%W mixture to approximately 85 degrees  the tie line at this temperature results in an approximately 60%E/40%W vapor.  If we condense the vapor and replenish ethanol to the system to maintain a constant temperature of approximately 85 degrees  the resultant condensed vapor (liquid) would be approximately 60%E/40%W.      Since this system exhibits an azeotrope at approximately 96%E/4%W  this is the maximum concentration of ethanol that can be achieved by simple distillation at this pressure."
0	"An enriched solution could be obtained by vaporization of the solution. According to the phase diagram  a vapor with a higher fraction of ethanol would be obtained. Adjusting the time and the amount of vapour created (of which the fraction of ethanol is decreasing more and more) a gas of the composition need could be obtained. When this gas is cooled down completely  you would have the composition neded.The horizontal line cutting the 15 % vertical line at the point when the latter goes through the liquidus tells you the composition of the vapor: It's the composition where the horizontal goes through the vaporidus (or whatever it might be called :)). As you can see  this does not allow for concentration of 100 %. Neither does any liquid with lower concentration in ethanol that might by obtained during vaporizing the liquid."
0	"Distillation.  Ethanol has a lower vaporization temperature than water  so you slowly heat the liquid up.  The vapors will be a higher concentration of ethanol than water.  You use a condenser to collect the vapors and turn them back into a liquid.  This is how rum  whiskey  vodka and other hard liquors are made.  You can't go to 100% in one step  because the maximum ethanol content of the vapor is determined by the right boundary of the upper curve  which doesn't go to 100% for any temperature that has a liquid-vapor phase at 15% ethanol."
0	"First we have to heat the system and gather the vapor generated -which will have more ethanol than water-.Then we have to condense that vapor and heat it again and gather the second vapor to condense it and heat it again -far more ethanol than water-.That way we get a solution richer in ethanol.We can not get 100 percent ethanol  because at one point the nth vapor gathered will have the same composition as the solution from where it came  that is called an azeotrope. Meaning that the ethanol you want to purify boils at a slightly higher temperature than the azeotrope. "
0	"On boiling  the liquid gets poor in ethanol  but I don't think that adding more of it to compensate is allowed in this problem. If we heat the mixture to 90C  we will get a vapor phase (36% of the total) with 40% ethanol. That would allow a greater efficiency in the process  but we have got to go 80C if we want 60% ethanol vapors here.So  if we separate the vapor phase  and drive it to 80C  we will get in the new system a vapor phase (50% of the total) with 60% ethanol. Overall  we got 17% of the original mixture as 60% ethanol in this two-step distillation without adding ethanol."

0	"By heating the mixture and next by cooling created vapor to a separate container we can distill a mixture with higher composition of ethanol. Above works because the quantity of vapor of ethylene will be proportionally higher than the quantity of water for the 15% composition. However the closer we get to 100% ethanol  the difference will get smaller so we won't be able to fully purify ethanol.  "

So  by heating the mixture  the most volatile component will concentrate to a greater degree in the vapor leaving the liquidSince ethanol evaporates faster than water  the ethanol rises through a tube  collects and condenses into another container. The water is left behind.At the concentration of 95% ethanol  water and ethanol form what is known as an azeotrope. This is a mixture in which the azeotrope distills off before the desired liquie (ethanol). Citing from my memory  ethanol boils at 78.3C and the azeotrope of 95% ethanol/water boils off at 78.15C.

0	"Using the fractional distillation procedure  by elevating the temperature of the system water-ethanol  one would vaporize and then condensate the components resulting in a solution that shows a composition of higher concentration of ethanol than the original solution. That happens because the vapor condensed in the distillation column has a higher concentration of ethanol (since it has the smaller boiling point). It's not possible to reach a composition of one hundred percent ethanol this way because once you achieve the azeotropic composition  both components will behave as a one component solution  and the distillation will proceed at a constant temperature  so  the composition won't change. On the other hand  it is possible to remove the remaining water by adding benzen and removing two azeotropes  first benzene-water-ethanol   then ethanol-benzene. The result material will be pure ethanol. "
0	"you would boil the solution and then lower the temperature.  as more water drops out  the vapor becomes more ethanol rich as it follows the curve to the right until it hits the percentage you are looking for.  you couldn't reach 100% with this because it would stop at the eutectic point  about 95%."
0	"You can heat the solution until it starts to boil. The phase diagram tells you that the first vapor will be highly concentrated in ethanol  while the remaining liquid will be highly concentrated in water (the intersection of the tie line and the liquidus gives you the concentration of the vapor while the intersection with the solidus gives you the concentration of the liquid). This vapor can be collected in another flask and will be 60 percent ethanol and 40 percent water if you do not let the temperature get to high. However  you cannot get completely pure ethanol because the vapor will have the concentration of the intersection between the tie line and the liquidus which has a maximum at roughly 96 percent (azeotropic point) (actually  the maximum is the intersection of the liquidus and the tie line that intersects the solidus at the initial concentration of the solution; however  if you take your distillate and distill it again  the new maximum concentration will be higher and aproach the azeotropic concentration with further distillation cycles).

0	"You have to start by rapidly raising the temperature above 100 C and boiling both of them away.   As the fraction of ethanol increases  the water will boil away at lower temperatures.  At the point where water is boiling away at 80 C  you will have the composition of elements you need.  You cannot reach 100% ethanol this way  because ethanol actually has a lower boiling point than water  so you cannot boil all of the water away.  I have thought about the question a little more and want to add that you can probably boil it at 80 C all along  because of the initial concentration of ethanol.  I think the Lever Rule could be used for a definite quantitative answer.  Sorry  I really need to sleep on all these questions!"

If you boiled the mixture  the water part would only just be turning to gas  but there would be more of the ethanol as gas as that would have started getting enough energy to be a gas for a longer time - so the vapour coming off would be more ethanol - somehow you could catch that somewhere else  and end up with more ethanol in that mixture.You probably couldn't get 100% ethanol because as you got closer to the eutectic point  the mixture would boil off and the vapour would actually tend to be lower in ethanol than you wanted (or the same constant 95% or whatever it is)  and you couldn't get it any higher this way."

The distillation temperature needs to be below the bottom boundary of the vapor phase and above the upper boundary of the liquid phase; referring to the phase diagram the horizontal line representing the appropriate temperature should intercept the vapor line where that line intercepts the vertical line for a 40/60 water/ethanol mix - i.e.  roughly 82 degrees C.  If the vapor mix is then drawn off and cooled to a point where it enters the liquid phase of the diagram  a condensate with the desired 40/60 mix should result.To further increase the proportion of ethanol  it is necessary to move further to the right on the phase diagram  which (due to the downward slope of the vapor line) means that the distillation temperature must be reduced.  However  from the diagram the lowest usable temperature will only produce an ethanol concentration of about 95% - reducing the temperature further will keep the mixture entirely within the liquid phase  rendering distillation impossible."

The composition of the vapor is given by the right side of the tie line at whatever temperature you are at  and that composition will be greater than 15%.  Physically separate the vapor from the liquid (with a pipe for example)  and then lower the temperature so it condenses.  You now have a liquid at a higher concentration of ethanol than before. Do it again  and the concentration will increase again. Continue until the concentration reaches 60 percent. You can continue this with diminishing returns as you move to the right in the L+V region of the phase diagram. The results diminish because the L+V portion of the phase diagram gets smaller and smaller  so it's hard to have a condition where you have a mix of vapor and liquid  which you need for this scheme to work.

Lower boiling component(ethanol) will preferentially vaporize first. This vapor passes into a distilling head and then into a condenser. Within the condenser the vapor is cooled and it liquefies. The resulting liquid is then collected in a receiving flask. So starting with a 15% ethanol - 85% water composition the ethanol distills first and is collected thereby increasing the concentration of the mixture to about 60% ethanol-40% water composition  as the water distills after the ethanol it can be regulated to get the appropriate composition.Furthermore  this procedure cannot be used to get a purity of 100% ethanol because the distillation vapor will be a mixture enriched in the lower boiling component(ethanol)  but still containing some of the higher boiling component(water). As the distillation proceeds  the liquid in the distilling pot will have a greater  and greater percentage of higher boiling component(water) if not stopped."
0	"Increasing the temperature up to the vapour state would decrease the content of water in the mixture  and so it would increase the fraction of ethanol in the mixture.we cannot reach a pure composition of ethanol because we reach the eutectic point with 95% of ethanol  and thus we vaporise the whole compound before reaching such composition."
0	"As the solution is heated above about 80 C  it moves into a phase that involves vapor and liquid water.  If the temperature is kept just at the point where vaporization begins  the ethanol content of the vapor will be right around 60%.If the solution is not heated to that temperature  no vaporization will occur; and if it is heated to a higher temperature  the ethanol content of the vapor will be lower.  Therefore 60% is about the best ethanol content that can be achieved through this process."
0	"Reducing temperature"
0	"You have to lower the temperature until around 65C to get the right ratio. You will not able to get 100% ethanol solution  because lowest line (liquid border) does not reach 100% axis  it reachs only until euthetic point."
0	"Bringing the mixture to the boiling point of ethanol and after cooling to temperature of 40C (approximately).This procedure ia a distillation.The maximum point at which the mixture will be distillable is azeotropic mixture  which is around 95%  so it couldnt reach a pure composition of ethanol"
0	"Heat the liquid above the boiling point of ethanol and catch the vapor in a collection container and allow it to cool.  Since the ethanol will vaporize first  the solution that you catch in the container will have a higher ethanol percentage.  You can't get 100% because some water will always be present in the collection container."
0	"Due to the differences in boiling points between ethanol and water  a temperature can be applied to the 15% mixture that evaporates the ethanol  whilst being insufficient to evaporate the water (on the diagram  this temperature would be in the liquid+vapour region). The evaporated ethanol can then be siphoned off  with water added to it to reach the desired concentration. Some water will still be present in the extracted and condensed vapour though  so this procedure must be carried out many times at lower and lower temperatures to continue to improve the yield. The % can not exceed that of the Eutectic composition (around 95%)  as the combined liquid goes straight to the gaseous phase at this point."
0	"adding more ethanol to make it to 60% ethanol. the amount of ethanol to be added can be calculated by ratio method.no matter how much ethanol added  there is still some of the water in the solution that was there earlier before adding the extra ethanol. "
0	"Enriching the mixture:1.Heat the initial mixture up to produce ethanol vapors(mixed with water vapors) along the water.2.Remove the vapors and cool them in closed system to obtain 'enriched' ethanol solution.3.Discard initial solution consisting now mainly of water4.Repeat as many times as needed.You cannot reach pure composition of ethanol this way beacause when you finally reach about 95% ethanol solution at circa 70 degrees Celsius you will start to get both the water and ethonol to evaporate at the same time. As a result you will get the same composition as you started with(95% ethanol)."
0	"If you heat up the mixture to about 90 C the mixture starts to evaporate  but since we are in water+ mixture vapour region  some fraction of water will stay in liquid phace. So we could collect the mixture vapour and cooled it down again. Since we remove some part of  liquid water  the new mixture composition would be closer to eutectic. When we reach eutectic point the composition remains the same then we heat it up and cool it down. "
0	"I see various possibilities:1. Add  liquid ethanol to the inicial solution at low temperature (<70C: all liquid). 100% ethanol isnt possible because this method doesnt remove the water.2. Cool the hot inicial vapor solution (>100C) down; it forms liquid water with elevated fraction of ethanol into the vapor. Filter the liquid water out. The vapor composition moves to the right in the diagram. With the appropriate temperature its is possible to reach at 95% ethanol in the vapor (at the eutectic point)."
0	"Heat 15% solution to approx 80C. Boiling occurs  with the vapor mixture produced (per my eyes) having a  composition that is ~60% ethanol/40% water.   Withdraw newly formed vapor and condense.If this process is repeated  (e.g. starting with 60/40 liquid)  it will boil at somewhat lower temp  and produce higher EtOH fraction.  But process will end at intersection of two phase groups (approx 96% EtOH.)  Any vapor produced from boiling at this point will have same concentration as liquid- so no further separation is possible."
0	"Enter response here.To do it  we can heat the solution until obtains a mixture of two phases: one ethanol - rich liquid phase and one water-rich vapor phase  with the composition that is needed; then after have  removed the liquid phase  we cool down  the obtained vapor phase to bring it in liquid phase.Furthermore  if we draw a vertical line at the point corresponding to the composition of the initial solution  we can observe that there is no point in it which can have a horizontal projection allowing to obtain a phase with 100 percent of ethanol. "
0	"To enrich a solution to a composition of 60% ethanol-40% water  one should heat up solution only to about bellow boiling point of ethanol  collect the vapor and then cool it down. The water and ethanol start vaporizing at temperature around 65 degrees C  so majority of ethanol will vaporize and only a small portion of water will vaporize with it.The procedure can not be used to reach a completely pure composition of 100% ethanol  because water and ethanol start vaporizing at very close temperatures  bellow the boiling point of ethanol  so the ethanol vapor will always contain a small percent of water."
0	"Because the ethanol mix up with the water and there arent big diferencie between each other "
0	"Temperature should be elevated above ca. 80C. There will be an equilibrium of a liquid (~10:90) and a vapor (~60:40).Vapor should be cooled down and collected  this will be the ethanol enriched solution."
0	"You can decrease the ethanol concentration by pressure drop. when you make the pressure drop  the water evaporates slowly than ethanol  so you gonna have a gas phase rich in ethanol."
0	"15-85 is above ethanol's boiling point.  Lowering temperature would condense more ethanol  until 60-40 is reached.Eutectic composition is roughly at 95% ethanol."
0	"We can enrich quantity of ethanol with vaporizing solution  and then condensing it. We cann't rich more than 85 percent of ethanol by this method because we system in this conditions have eutectic  and vapor will have the same quantity of ethanol and water as the condensed solution "
0	"By fixing a temperature and reducing the presure  we can modify the composition of the mixture"
0	"Heat the solution so that it maintains a constant temperature T where the composition of the vapor has the desired amount of ethanol (in this case  60%).  This temperature can be found from the phase diagram as the temperature corresponding to the intersection of the vertical line at 60% and the upper curve (the vaporous?).  Allow this vapor to cool away from the original solution to produce a 60% ethanol solution in liquid phase.  This procedure cannot make pure ethanol as there will always be some number of highly energetic water molecules which will mix in the vapor phase  the number being governed by the Boltzmann distribution.  "
0	"Using the fractional distillation procedure under standard ambient temperature and pressure (25C and 1 atm)  by elevating the temperature of the system water-ethanol  you'd constantly vaporize and condensate the components until you get a solution that shows a composition of higher concentration of ethanol than the original solution. That happens because the vapor condensed in the distillation column has a higher concentration of ethanol (since it has the smaller boiling point). It's not possible to reach a composition of 100% ethanol this way because once you achieve the azeotrope composition  both components will behave as a one component solution  and the distillation will proceed at a constant temperature  so  the composition won't change. Though  it's possible to remove the remaining water by adding benzen and removing two azeotropes  first benzen-water-ethanol (bp 65C)  then ethanol-benzen (bp 68C). The result material will be pure ethanol. "
