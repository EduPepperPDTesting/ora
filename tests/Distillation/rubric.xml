		By raising the temperature of the ethanol-water solution into the range
		of the two phase region, one is able to separate the system into an
		ethanol-rich vapor phase and a water-rich liquid phase. The vapor phase can be
		separated from the liquid and collected.

       <option> The vapor can then be continually
		cooled and heated through additional distillation steps, separating off the
		ethanol-rich vapor phase until the desired composition is reached.

		The procedure could not be used to completely purify ethanol from water
		because of the congruent vaporization point at approximately 95% ethanol. As
		one moves across the two-phase region to the left of this point purification is
		able to occur due to the presence of the two-phase region. At this point
		however, the system will no longer phase separate as the temperature is varied,
		hence purification cannot continue.
