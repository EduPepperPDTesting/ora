0	"It is a polybutadiene is termoset and has covalent bonds  and polyethylene has ionic bonds. "
0	"Monomers such as ethylene with a double bond can form polymers by opening up the double bond and linking other monomers to each of the two carbon atoms previously linked by a double bond  but now left with a single bond.  If there are only two sites on the monomer  which can be joined to other monomers a single chain (not cross-linked) will result.  If there are more than two sites on the monomer that can link to other monomers cross-linking can occur.  1 3-butadiene has two double bonds.  If these are opened up monomers can be linked to the first and fourth carbon atoms leaving a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms.  This can form part of chain with either cis- or trans- configuration the extent of each depending very much on the catalyst used.  In any case the many remaining double bonds can be opened up to link to other monomers or polymer chains giving rise to cross-links.        "
0	"Polybutadiene has a carbon double bond that can be broken and linked to.  Polyethylene has no bonds to easily break and link to."
0	"the symmetry of polyethylene allow for it to be linked in any orientation and remain the same in effect. while polybutadiene only has 1 way symmetry  meaning if it is placed in a different orientation  e.g. top down vs bottom up  will make it effectively different. "
0	"polyethylene is composed of a a repeating structure which contains only single carbon bonds  there is no double bonds to enable the addition of of a radical and cross-linking; additional ethyl groups can only be added at the ends. But polybutadiene does contain double bonds  which causes mean that it can be cross-linked because there are locations other then the ends where structures can be attached."
0	"The carbon double bond in the polybutadiene monomer allows for crosslinking. My understanding of it is that the methyl groups at the ends of the monomer allow for regular end to end polymerization  but can also attack the carbon double bond in the center of the monomer to crosslink molecules.  This occurs because the carbon in the methyl group at the ends of the monomers wants to have four bonds.  "
0	"A peroxide in the polyethylene will not let the polytthylene molecules to crosslink."
0	"Polyethylene has no double bonds in its polymer-chain  while polybutadiene does.  This lets a base break the carbon-carbon double bond in polybutadiene and another chain can connect there.  This means that each polybutadiene node can connect to three chains  while polyethylene can only connect to two chains.  This multiple connectivity allows cross-linking."
0	"A cross link is a chemical bond between polymer chains other than at the ends. Polybutadiene can be crossed linked as it has a carbon-carbon double bond that can be easily broken to form new bonds with other molecules. Polyethylene is a linear chain molecule without carbon-carbon double. Therefore it is not easier to make links between co-polymer molecules. "
0	"because polybutadiene has another substance added to it that glues together all the ends there for making it cross-linked."
0	"The polybutadiene has two centers where it can build chains with other radicals or starters "
0	"To create a polymer we need to form a new bond  that attaches two molecules. It consumes a bond  that must be broken - so it must be double bond - to form polymer without breaking chain. Crosslinked polymer goes further - it also cosume additional bond to create a bridge and this bond must exist after first polymerisation.It explains  why it needs to use components with two double bonds and why polymer such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked. "
0	" 1 3-Butadiene is an organic compound that is a simple conjugated diene hydrocarbon (dienes have two carbon-carbon double bonds). Polybutadiene forms by linking many 1 3-butadiene monomers to make a much longer polymer chain molecule. In terms of the connectivity of the polymer chain  butadiene can polymerize in three different ways  called cis  trans and vinyl. The cis and trans forms arise by connecting the butadiene molecules end-to-end  so-called 1 4-polymerisation. The properties of the resulting isomeric forms of polybutadiene differ. For example  high cis-polybutadiene has a high elasticity and is very popular  whereas the so-called high trans is a plastic crystal with few useful application. The vinyl content of polybutadiene is typically no more than a few percent. In addition to these three kinds of connectivity  polybutadienes differ in terms of their branching and molecular weights.The ingredient or monomer is ethylene (IUPAC name ethene). It has the formula C2H4  consisting of a pair of CH2 groups connected by a double bond.Because the catalysts are highly reactive  the ethylene must be of high purity. Typical specifications are <5 ppm for water  oxygen  as well as other alkenes. Acceptable contaminants include N2  ethane (common precursor to ethylene)  and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources  but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol"
0	"Butadiene contains more than one double bond whilst ethylene only contains one. This means  that besides having more electron rich sites (essential for polymerization reactions) than ethylene  butadiene can also form crosslinked polymers  since the carbon backbone is not linear like ethylene and it contains more sites for addition. Ethylene has two factors against cross linking of its polymer: linear carbon backbone (spatial restrictions do not allow cross linking) and it has only one electron-site rich."
0	"Polybutadiene has two double bonds in the repeat unit (CH2=CH-CH=CH2)  as one of them is reduced to a single bond to form the chain during polymerization  the other is available to cross-link to another chain.Polyethylene  on the other hand  has only one doube bond in the repeat unit (CH2=CH2)  so there is nothing left to cross-link once after polimerization."
0	"Etylene has only one double bond which is used up during the polymerization  meaning repeat units can only be added to the end of a long chain Butadiene also builds up a chain like etylene  however there is still another double bond left in the repeat unit after reaction  which can react again with a repeat unit at a later point in time to give a side-arm to the polymere chain. This side-arm can then also continue to grow  arc more  etc. etc."
0	"The Polybutadiene repeating unit has double-bonds that allow for the polymer chains to form in a variety of ways(cis trans etc.)  depending on which orientation the additional monomers will bond to the polymer chain. Since the repeating unit has a double-bond  it can also react with other polymer chains to create the cross-links. Polyethylene  on the other hand has a repeating unit that has a single Carbon bond along the backbone  which prevents the polymer chain from having the multiple ways of forming like polybutadiene(it will have a more linear construction)  and the lack of the additional double-bond prevents it from cross-linking effectively to other chains  since there are no additional bonds that can be easily created to join them."
0	"because polybutadiene has two double bonds while polyethlene only has one.the function of two double bonds is just like the bridge  which enable them to cross linke"
0	"Because the polybutadiene is a compound found in three ways (cis  trans vinyl) can form cross-links such as glass  whereas the polyethylene is a linear polymer chain simple and does not allow branches or crosslinks"
0	"Polyethylene contains no reactive functional groups  polybutadiene contains a pi bond with can be opened and added to by an initiator and a nucleophile. "
0	"Polybutadiene  unlike polyethylene  has an additional carbon double bond which can be branched (and thus cross-linked) through an addition reaction. polyethylene does not even have a spare carbon for branching."
0	"Polybutadiene repeat unit has a double bond and a chain of four carbons that it isn't linear   then it means more links when a double bonds are breaking under different angles. Indeed  polyethylene repeat unit is linear and these doesn't allow cross-linked."
0	"For a linear polymerization of the anionic polymerization (Michael reaction) type one needs one double bond per molecule. A second double bond would allow then to do an inter-chain reaction of the same type.   "
0	"Enter essay here.they are three types of solid polymers: elastomers  thermoplastic polymers  andthermosetting polymers. Elastomers are rubbers or rubberlike elastic materials.Thermoplastic polymers are hard at room temperature  but on heating becomesoft and more or less fluid and can be molded. Thermosetting polymers canbe molded at room temperature or above  but when heated more stronglybecome hard and infusible. These categories overlap considerably but arenonetheless helpful in defining general areas of utility and types of structures.The structural characteristics that are most important to determiningthe properties of polymers are: (1) the degree of rigidity of the polymer molecules (2) the electrostatic and van der Waals attractive forces between thechains  (3) the degree to which the chains tend to form crystalline domains and (4) the degree of cross-linking between the chains. Consider a polymer made of a tangle of molecules with long linearchains of atoms. If the intermolecular forces between the chains are small andthe material is subjected to pressure  the molecules will tend to move past oneanother in what is called plastic flow. Such a polymer usually is soluble insolvents that will dissolve short-chain molecules with chemical structuressimilar to those of the polymer. If the intermolecular forces between the chainsare sufficiently strong to prevent motion of the molecules past one another thepolymer will be solid at room temperature  but will usually lose strength andundergo plastic flow when heated. Such a polymer is thermoplastic. A crosslinkis a chemical bond between polymer chains other than at the ends. Crosslinksare extremely important in determining physical properties because theyincrease the molecular weight and limit the translational motions of the chainswith respect to one another. Only two cross-links per polymer chain are requiredto connect all the polymer molecules in a given sample to produce onegigantic molecule. Only a few cross-links  reduce greatly thesolubility of a polymer and tend to produce what is called a gel polymer  which although insoluble  usually will absorb  solvents in which theuncross-linked polymer is soluble.

0	"polybutadiene has multiple double bonds - such that more than a linear connectivity can occur in the polymerization reaction.  PE reaction has a single double bond - thus polymerization will propogate linearly"
0	"Polybutadiene withdraws electron density (due to the double bonds) while polyethylene doesn't. Therefore  polyethylene cannot be cross-linked."
0	"Because in the polyethylene the carbons are linked with hydrogens and in the case of the polybutadiene there are two methyl groups which could link with other carbons."
0	"Because in polyethlene there is only a double bond and a monomer can bonds with only two others monomers.Butadiene can bonds with other  4 monomers to form polybutadiene  so can be cross-linked. "
0	"Enter essay here.When we observe polyethylene repeat unit  there is only simple carbon-carbon bonds.  But in  a polybutadiene repeat unit  we note the presence of a double carbon-carbon bond from  which it can be formed bonds between many chains."
0	"As polybutadiene has 2 hydrogen atoms plus the 2 CH2 groups it can be cross-linked through the H position but the polyethylene has no positions where it can be cross-linked"
0	"If you want a polymer to be cross-linked  the units have to be polar or at least there should be a functional group that attracts electron from a carbon which the group is binded with. Ethylene is symmetrical molecule only with two carbons connected with double bond and four hydrogens connected to carbons. On the other hand  when we look at one carbon in butadiene we can see that it is connected to at least one group containing double bond which has bigger potential to attract an electron. And as the cross-linking is related to anionic polymerization  this cannot occur in case of non-polar ethylene."
0	"Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because of the double bond on it's structure  it's very reactive (it can make bonds with other molecules)  but in the other hand the polyethylene doesn't has the ability to make bonds. it lacks of any reactive functional group like -OH."

0	"Due to the presense of a double bond  polybutadiene can be cross linked. "
0	"unlike polyethylene  where only hydrogen exists on each of the backbone carbon  each polybutadiene repeating unit has an ethylene group attached to one of the carbon.  The double bonded carbon on the ethylene provides additional sites for strong base to attack and thus allow crosslinking.  In general the functional group on each repeating units should be at least sp2 hybridized.  functional groups such as ethylene and nitrile are good candidates.  "
0	"Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because of the presence of the second pi bond. When polymerizing the monomers  the double bond is used up to create the link between two monomers. If there's a second double bond  a second link can be created between sets of monomers."
0	"The presence of the carbon-carbon double bond in the repeating unit of polybutadiene allows carbons from two different polymer chains to form a crosslinking bond when that double-bond is broken.The saturated structure of polyethylene means that the formation of these crosslinks is impossible (unless  perhaps  the substance is imparted sufficient energy to break the carbon-hydrogen bonds)."
0	"The polyethylene structure does not have the methyl groups that offer the cross-linking opportunity seen in the polybutadiene structure.  "
0	"The molecule of butadiene  can be polymerized in three different ways  resulting in three isomers called cis  trans and vinyl. Polybutadiene properties are different according to the proportion of each of these isomers in their molecules contain. Thus  for example polybutadiene called high-cis has high elasticity and very appreciated as the so-called high-trans is a plastic crystalline without. utility application.The polyethylene (PE) polymer is chemically more simple. It is represented by its repeating unit (CH2-CH2) n. It is one of the most common plastics  due to its high global production and its low price. It is chemically inert. It is obtained from the polymerization of ethylene from which it derives its name.This polymer can be produced by different polymerization reactions  such as: free radical polymerization  anionic polymerization  coordination polymerization or cationic polymerization ion. Each of these reaction mechanisms produces a different type of polyethylene.Is a linear chain polymer unbranched. Although the branches are common commercial products. Polyethylene chains are arranged under the softening temperature Tg in amorphous and semicrystalline."

0	"Polybutadiene has double bonds which allows cross links."
0	"Polybutadiene is composed of monomers that contain still double bonds across the whole length of the molecule after polmerisation. These double bonds can be converted to single bonds in a type of initiation reaction in order to couple  and create cross links other polybutadiene molecules. Polyethylene does neither have double bonds nor multiple active ends that can couple to other polyethylene molecules  so cross linking is not possible."
0	"Polyethylene has only one double bond per unit  so only 2 additional units can link to it  resulting in a linear (though crooked) polymer.  Polybutadiene has two double bonds per unit  allowing up to 4 additional molecules to link to it.  Since only 2 additional molecules are required to form a linear chain  the remaining 2 link possibilities can serve to join linear chains together (cross-linking)."
0	"The polyethylene monomer C2H4 expands in only one direction during polymerization.The butadiene monomer C4H6 can expand in several directions  while retaining C double bond cross linking."
0	"For a polymer to be able to be cross-linked  there must be a carbon-carbon double bond in the repeat unit  so that the cross-linking agent may break that bond to link itself to it. While there remains a carbon-carbon double bond in a repeat unit in polybutadiene  such double bonds are lost in polyethylene in the process of polymerization. "
0	"Polybutadiene has several double bonds  each of which can react to cross-link to other double bond locations in other molecules. Polyethylene only has one double bond  so it can react only with one other molecule at a time  forming long chains. It does not have the ability to form multiple links to several other molecules."
0	"Polybutadiene retains a double C=C bond after polymerization allowing a radical to attach and radicalize a part of the polymer opening it up to crosslinking.  Polyethylene has only single bonds leaving no place but the ends of the chain for radical activity."
0	"Cross-linking can only occur when there are double bonded carbons.  One of the bonds gets broken and therefore is available to bond to something else.  Polybutadiene has double bonded carbons  so it can be cross-linked  and polyethylene does not have double bonded carbons  so it cannot."
0	"Because polybutadiene has two methyl groups and isn't as linear as polyethylene."
0	"Polybutadiene's monomer is butadiene. It's a hydrocarbon with two double bonds  i.e. it has two sites for polymerization. Polyethylene is constructed from ethylene molecules  which in its turn have only one double bond and thus single site available for polymerization. Cross-linking requires at least two  polymerization sites from each monomer  that's why only polybutadiene can be cross-linked in this case."

0	"-"
0	"The repeating unit for polybutadiene is 1 3-butadiene  which contains two C-C double-bonds. Both of the double-bonds in the repeating unit can be broken  which provides two opportunities for a potential reaction with a cross-linking molecule. By contrast  polyethylene's repeating unit is ethylene  which contains only one C-C double bond  and thus only one reaction possibility for a potential cross-linker. However  cross-linking requires multiple reaction possibilities for repeating units to be able to be tied together in a cross-linked network."
0	"In order to have cross-linking  the monomer has to have at least three locations where it can bond to another monomer. Ethene only has two such locations  while butadiene  in principle  has four such locations. This is because butadiene has two double bonds  each of which allow two monomers to be added."
0	"Because butadiene has 2 doubled bonds and he can be crosslinked unlike ethylene"
0	"Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double C-C bond in one molecule of butadiene after polymerization. It can also destruct and get formation with such another. Also the vulcanization process can sew together the carbon atoms near the double bond by polysulfide bonds (for example -S-S-S- trisulfide bond). But polyethylene can't do this because there aren't double bonds in the polymer molecule."

0	"In the structure of polybutadiene each repeating unit has one double bond between two carbons  if this double bond breaks it is possible to have one branch this new branch can make a cross link however in repeating unit of polyethylene there is no double bond therefore it is impossible to make cross linked structure. "
0	"because polybutadiene  are easily dissolved  in solvents"
0	"Polyethylene is a completely saturated polymer in which all the carbon atoms are connected by single bonds and cannot therefore form branches and take part in cross linking. Polybutadiene  however  with double bonds along the carbon backbone  can add more monomer units both to the ends of the growing chain (1 4 addition) and also to the double bonds as part of the chain (1 2 or vinyl addition). The amount of branching in polybutadiene is controlled by the choice of catalyst."
0	"The polybutadiene repeating unit has a double bond within it so that there are variants in subunits (cis and trans). This means the polymer chain can bend and branch more than the polyethylene chains which will be linear. The additional connectivity of the polybutadiene subunits will lead to the ability to crosslink the polymers  while the linear polyethylene chains will not."
0	"polyethylene has a weaker carbon to carbon bond than polybutadiene"
0	"In the case of Polybutadiene(PB)  the structure of the monomer repeating unit ie. Butadiene is branched and the crosslinking can be carried out easily compared to PolyEthylene(PE) since PE has a linear structure.P.S. I cant totally agree to the statement that PE cannot be cross-linked.PE may be of different types. A High Density PE has a Linear Structure whereas a low density PE or LDPE has a branched structure  thus making it easier to crosslink. "
0	"Polybutadiene can be crosslinked because  after the polymerization has begun  the to-be-added monomer can go to the end of the chain or actually break the double bond of the previously added monomer  thus creating two new places for the next monomer to add to; if repeated  many ends will link  rendering a cross-linked polymer.On the other hand  ethylene only has one double bond; so  after being broken  the next to-be-added monomer has no other place to attach to  which will create a linear  non-cross-linked polymer."
0	"The repeating unit must have multiple places where bonds can be made to several other repeating units to allow cross linking."
0	"In order to be able to crosslink between different polymer chains one needs a third attachement point. e.g after the two reactive sites are used up to produce the linear chain the third reactive site can be utilized to connect two different linear chains. When polybutadiene is formed  a double bond remains within each repeat unit which can undergoe a similar reaction as the polymerization  leading to a crosslinked or at least branched polymer. In PE there is no such extra DB after the polymerization has taken place."
0	"The units that are linked in polybutadiene are very weak and hence easily gets reduced so that it can be cross-linked. However the bond is quite strong in ethylene or polyethylene and hence it is not easily reduced  thus preventing cross leading."
0	"Many 1 3-butadiene builds polybutadiene. One molecule of butadiene have 2 double bond which can react in polymerization process. Each butadiene can react in 2 ways with polymer chain. The polymerization conditions influence on that which double bond make a new bond with polymer chain. Ethylene have only one double bond which must react with polymer chain and polyethylene is not cross-linked it is linear. "
0	"Polybutadiene is formed from a monomer that is a conjugated diene  so it has a double bond in its polymer structure  which allows for further crosslinking.  On the other hand  polyethylene does not have a double bond in its repeating structure  so such crosslinking is not possible.  "
0	"Polybutadiene has a double carbon-carbon bond in every reapeating unit. One of them (pi bond) can be transformed into sigma carbon-carbon bond between carbons of different repeating units of the same polymer molecule. Consequently  polymer becomes cross-linked. Polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because all possible sigma bonds between carbons are formed and new cannot be created without breaking the old ones in the same polymer."

0	"The polybutadiene has two centers where it can build chains with other radicals or starters .So it build a crosslinked polymer "
0	"A polymer like polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double bond in its repeat unit which can be broken  allowing bonds to form between two polymers. However  polyethylene doesn't have any available bonds off of the carbon atoms in its repeating unit to connect one polymer to another  so it cannot be cross-linked."
0	"Polyurethane is commonly used to denote a variety of polymeric materials which include elastomers  which may be thermoplastic or crosslinked.

0	"The polybutadiene can be cross-linked because the chains are linked together extensively by covalent bonds  while the polyethylene cannot be cross-linked because the chemical structure can't permit it."
0	"Cross-linking requires that the chain reaction can proceed from multiple ends after a carbon double bond has been broken. Polybutadiene with its CH2 group can provide these multiple ends. Polyethylene however with its CH group only provides a single end from where the chain reaction can proceed. The chain reaction on polyethylene is thus restricted to linear development  and no cross-links can form."
0	"Polyethylenes are thermoplastic in nature and therefore they can not be reprocessed repeatedly. It however will soften and flow  and lose critical physical properties at temperature thereby limiting its applications. Therefore cross-linking of polyethylene is carried out to retain desirable properties at high temperature. Cross-linking will change the nature of polymer from thermoplastic to thermoset to yield a non-melting  more durable polymer matrix.Butadiene is left with a second double bond when it polymerizes  making cross chains possible."
0	"A cross-link is generally when a polymer is chained(linked) to another polymer. For polymers to be cross linked it has to have a bond which can sacrifice an electron to form another bond  such as double bonds and triple bonds. Single bonds however do not have any way to sacrifice an electron to form a link. In polybutadiene the C=C bond inside the repeating unit is why it can form cross links with other polymers while in polyethylene a C-C bond exists which is unable to form any bonds(links) with another polymer due to the insufficiency of electrons to form bonds."
0	"Polybutadiene has several double Carbon bonds and Polyethylene has not. "

This initiator molecule can react with one polybutadiene chain on one end and with another polybutadiene chain on the other to give the cross-linking.  Polyethylene has no functional group in it that can be reacted so it cannot be cross-linked."
0	"Cross linking is the process by which we join or link polymer chains together so as to improve the polymers properties like better strength or to increase the density. Polybutadiene has a carbon carbon double bond which can be used to react with a cross linker and so it can be cross linked. While in the case of polyethylene we have all single bonds between the carbon carbon atoms  so any attempt to further cross link the polyethylene polymer  may not improve its properties or might break the polymer altogether."

0	"A crosslink is a bond between two polymer chains. This is possible in polybutadiene becuase the repeat unit contains a double bond. This double bond can be broken to form a cross link bond with another polymer chain. polyethylene does not contain any double bons and so cannot form any additional bonds to form cross links."
0	"Ethylene has only one carbon double bond  which disappears when it is incorporated in the polymer polyethylene. So there is no double bond left in the polymer to create other branches. It can only grow linearly.On the contrary  butadiene has two carbon double bonds. So  after one is used to link a monomer to the polymer  there is one remaining where another chain can attach itself. So cross-links can be created in polybutadiene."
