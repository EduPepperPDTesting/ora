Explain why a polymer such as polybutadiene can be cross-linked, however a polymer such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked. Make reference to what it is about the chemistry of the repeating units that allows for the formation of cross-links. The structures for polyethylene and polybutadiene repeat units can be found earlier in the sequence questions.
