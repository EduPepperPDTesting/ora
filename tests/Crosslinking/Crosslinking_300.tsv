0	"Butadiene contains more than one double bond whilst ethylene only contains one. This means  that besides having more electron rich sites (essential for polymerization reactions) than ethylene  butadiene can also form crosslinked polymers  since the carbon backbone is not linear like ethylene and it contains more sites for addition. Ethylene has two factors against cross linking of its polymer: linear carbon backbone (spatial restrictions do not allow cross linking) and it has only one electron-site rich."

0	"Cross-linking can only occur when there are double bonded carbons.  One of the bonds gets broken and therefore is available to bond to something else.  Polybutadiene has double bonded carbons  so it can be cross-linked  and polyethylene does not have double bonded carbons  so it cannot."
0	"Polybutadiene  unlike polyethylene  has an additional carbon double bond which can be branched (and thus cross-linked) through an addition reaction. polyethylene does not even have a spare carbon for branching."
0	"Polymers such polybutadiene can be cross-linked due to the presence of double bonds in the polymer chain  which are susceptible to react with the crosslinking agent.Polymers such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked  because the polymer chain does not contain any double bond or functional groups to react with the crosslink agent."

0	"polyethylene is composed of a a repeating structure which contains only single carbon bonds  there is no double bonds to enable the addition of of a radical and cross-linking; additional ethyl groups can only be added at the ends. But polybutadiene does contain double bonds  which means that it can be cross-linked because there are locations other then the ends where structures can be attached."
0	"Polyethene does not contain any more double bonds which could react in an addition polymerisation section. In fact all carbons atoms are fully saturated and C-C single (and C-H) bonds are hard to break. Polybutadiene however contains a double bond between the two central carbons in each repeat unit. The pi-bond will break more easily and can undergo further addition polymerisation reaction between individual strands of the polymer  thus cross-linking it."

0	"Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because of the presence of the second pi bond. When polymerizing the monomers  the double bond is used up to create the link between two monomers. If there's a second double bond  a second link can be created between sets of monomers."
0	"To create a polymer we need to form a new bond  that attaches two molecules. It consumes a bond  that must be broken - so it must be double bond - to form polymer without breaking chain. Crosslinked polymer goes further - it also cosume additional bond to create a bridge and this bond must exist after first polymerisation.It explains  why it needs to use components with two double bonds and why polymer such as polyethylene cannot be cross-linked. "
0	"Because geometry of polybutadiene allows to roll over itself and conect at the end of each molecule with another butadiene  making de cross linking effect. However  the polyethylene  has a more geometric structure."
0	"A cross-link is generally when a polymer is chained(linked) to another polymer. For polymers to be cross linked it has to have a bond which can sacrifice an electron to form another bond  such as double bonds and triple bonds. Single bonds however do not have any way to sacrifice an electron to form a link. In polybutadiene the C=C bond inside the repeating unit is why it can form cross links with other polymers while in polyethylene a C-C bond exists which is unable to form any bonds(links) with another polymer due to the insufficiency of electrons to form bonds."
0	"Polybutadiene can be crossed linked as it has a carbon-carbon double bond that can be easily broken to form new bonds with other molecules. Polyethylene is a linear chain molecule without carbon-carbon double. Therefore it is not easier to make links between molecules. "

The polymer can grow on either ends and does not leave double bonds for the repeating units to form cross-links with. Polybutadiene on the other hand does allow for cross-lining because of the double-bond which remains with each of the repeating units."
0	"Poly butadiene forms triple carbon bonds  and becomes a set plastic material. Polyethylene does not."
0	"In order to support cross-linking  it must be possible for the polymer chain to be branched (so that there are places for the cross-links to anchor).  In carbon-based chains such as polyethylene and polybutadiene  this requires the presence of a double-bond somewhere in the repeating unit that can be opened up to provide two single bonds - one to support the continued presence of a polymer chain  and the other to join with the cross-linking unit(s).   Polybutadiene possesses such a double bond  and can therefore be cross-linked  but polyethylene does not.  In polyethylene  the original double-bond in the ethylene monomer is fully used up in forming the original polymer chain."

0	"Ethylene has only one double bond in its structure  therefore can only react with another double bond from another ethylene group.Whereas butadiene has 2 double bonds in its structure  therefore 2 possibilities of propagation is possible and create cross-linking between different butadiene."
0	"The Polybutadiene repeating unit has double-bonds that allow for the polymer chains to form in a variety of ways(cis trans etc.)  depending on which orientation the additional monomers will bond to the polymer chain. Since the repeating unit has a double-bond  it can also react with other polymer chains to create the cross-links. Polyethylene  on the other hand has a repeating unit that has a single Carbon bond along the backbone  which prevents the polymer chain from having the multiple ways of forming like polybutadiene(it will have a more linear construction)  and the lack of the additional double-bond prevents it from cross-linking effectively to other chains  since there are no additional bonds that can be easily created to join them."
0	"Polybutadiene withdraws electron density (due to the double bonds) while polyethylene doesn't. Therefore  polyethylene cannot be cross-linked."

0	"in polybutadiene the monomer has two double bonds and both in different planes so its polymer can be cross-linked but in case of polyethylene there is a tripple bond and planar  structure so it does not forms cross-linkages. "
0	"Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because it has a double C-C bond in one molecule of butadiene after polymerization. It can also destruct and get formation with such another. Also the vulcanization process can sew together the carbon atoms near the double bond by polysulfide bonds (for example -S-S-S- trisulfide bond). But polyethylene can't do this because there aren't double bonds in the polymer molecule."
0	"The repeating unit of polybutadiene has a double bond while the repeating unit of polyethylene does not. A cross-linker can therefore bind with polybutadiene - it reduces a double bond to a single bond and binds with a carbon atom - while allowing the polymer to stay bonded. The same is impossible to do with polyethylene because the cross-linker cannot bind to carbon separating the polymer in two."
0	"In order for cross-linking to occur  the monomer must have at least two functional groups (e.g. C=C bond) that are able to polymerise. Butadiene has two double bonds  meaning that any given monomer is able to link to two other monomers  producing a cross-link. Ethylene has only one double bond  meaning that each monomer can link to only one other monomer  producing a linear chain."
0	"Polyethylene has no carbon to carbon double bond in the polymer chain  while polybutadiene has CC double bond in the polymer chain. A strong base or anion can break these double bonds and starts new chains from those double bonds. This is what enables polybutadiene to be cross-linked. "
0	"The polybutadiene monomer consists of  double bonded carbons with a CH2 and H group attached to each of the double bonded carbons.  The polyethylene monomer consists also of double bonded carbons; however  all of the double bonded carbons are attached to only H atoms.  The polybutadiene has steroisomerism with restricted rotation that when reacted with a crosslinking agent can switch forms from cis to trans.  This type of reaction is not possible with the structure of polyethylene."

0	"because polybutadiene has two double bonds while polyethlene only has one.the function of two double bonds is just like the bridge  which enable them to cross linke"
0	"Cross-links are produced through anionic polymerization  which requires a carbon-carbon double bond.  This bond is attacked by an anion initiator  which breaks one of the two carbon-carbon bonds  replacing the double bond with a single bond and a new bond to the initiator.  Polybutadiene possesses a carbon-carbon double bond which can be used in anionic polymerization to produce cross-linking  while polyethylene does not posses a carbon-carbon double bond  only a single bond  and thus cannot undergo anionic polymerization and cannot be cross-linked."
0	"Polyethylenes are thermoplastic in nature and therefore they can not be reprocessed repeatedly. It however will soften and flow  and lose critical physical properties at temperature thereby limiting its applications. Therefore cross-linking of polyethylene is carried out to retain desirable properties at high temperature. Cross-linking will change the nature of polymer from thermoplastic to thermoset to yield a non-melting  more durable polymer matrix.Butadiene is left with a second double bond when it polymerizes  making cross chains possible."

0	"Enter essay here.It happens because requires at least two double bonds in a molecule to crosslink happen"
0	"Polyehtylene cannot be cross-linked as its monomer (ethylene) has only one pi bond  so when activated by a radical or a base the radical becomes attached to one side while the other becomes a radical to activate another monomer an so on. It can only be linear.While in polybutadiene there's two pi bonds  the radical or the base is attached to one bond forming linear chains as in polyethylene but remains another bond that can be broken by an activator to connect another chain in the same monomer (cross-link)."

0	"Because butadiene has 2 doubled bonds and he can be crosslinked unlike ethylene"
0	"Cross linking is the process by which we join or link polymer chains together so as to improve the polymers properties like better strength or to increase the density. Polybutadiene has a carbon carbon double bond which can be used to react with a cross linker and so it can be cross linked. While in the case of polyethylene we have all single bonds between the carbon carbon atoms  so any attempt to further cross link the polyethylene polymer  may not improve its properties or might break the polymer altogether."
0	"The main reason is that polybutadiene has a double bound  which enables him to react with inintiatior and  consequently  crosslink with another polybutadiene. "
0	"In order for cross linking to occur  there has to be multiple points for the polymerization to initiate.  Since the polyethylene polymer is made from a molecule with no possible isomers  there is only one unit can be formed  whereas the polybutadiene can be formed from cis or trans isomers resulting in different possible sites and different branches.  "

0	"Ethylene has only one double bond & can (essentially) only polymerise linearly.  The radical generated on the end of the molecule interacts with the double bond on another monomer unit to generate a further radical & the reaction propagates.Butadiene has two double bonds.  There are  conceivably  two polymerisation mechanisms.The radical can propagate from C1 through C2 and onto another butadiene monomer molecule  thus leaving a pendant ethylenic grouping: -(CH2-CH (CH=CH2)-CH2-CH...) etc.  This unsaturated side chain can then  be considered as a new monomer unit  which can form a branched structure when it contacts another growing radical.  This ultimately would lead to cross-linking via the propagation or combination termination of the branches.Alternatively  and more likely: Butadiene has conjugated double bonds & the radical flow can occur through C1 to C4  thus leaving a new double bond between C2 & C3: -CH2-CH=CH-CH2-)n- .  Here a new double bond has also been generated  which can form branches & crosslinks in a similar manner as before.  For the 1 4-polymerisation cis- & trans- forms of  polymer (polymer segments) are possible."
0	"For a polymer to be able to be cross-linked  there must be a carbon-carbon double bond in the repeat unit  so that the cross-linking agent may break that bond to link itself to it. While there remains a carbon-carbon double bond in a repeat unit in polybutadiene  such double bonds are lost in polyethylene in the process of polymerization. "

Polyethylene contains no such double bonds or other functional groups that could act as a site of reaction with a cross-linking agent  and thus cannot be cross-linked."
0	"Polyethylene is a completely saturated polymer in which all the carbon atoms are connected by single bonds and cannot therefore form branches and take part in cross linking. Polybutadiene  however  with double bonds along the carbon backbone  can add more monomer units both to the ends of the growing chain (1 4 addition) and also to the double bonds as part of the chain (1 2 or vinyl addition). The amount of branching in polybutadiene is controlled by the choice of catalyst."
0	"Cross-linking refers to forming bonds between polymer chains at various points along their lengths. In order to do this without breaking the spine of each individual chain  it is necessary for the repeating unit to have a double or triple bond. After the cross-linking  this former double bond along the spine will be a single bond  and there will be a new single cross-linking bond connecting this chain with another. The polybutadiene repeat unit has a double bond and so polybutadiene can be cross-linked  but the polyethylene repeat unit does not have a double bond and so polyethylene cannot be cross-linked.(The term cross-linking is sometimes also used to refer to joining the loose ends of several polymer chains by means of a cross-linking agent that is able to bond with the ends of a number of chains. This is the case in RTV caulk  where each molecule of methyl triacetate silane bonds with three ends of silicone chains.  In this case a double bond in the polymer chain itself is not strictly required. The previous paragraph refers to cross-linking along a chain rather than at the ends  and without necessarily having a cross-linking agent.)"

When the polybutadiene is formed the backbone of the polymer has a Carbon-Carbon double bond for every 4th bond between the carbon atoms. These bonds can be broken in order to form another bond. These bonds can form between chains. "

This leaves the carbon atoms with no provision to form any more bonds and hence no provision for cross links.But   in the case of butadiene   there are two C-C double bonds. On polymerization   one double bond remains in the repeat unit. This can be utilized by the respective carbon atoms for cross-linking between different chains."

Polyethylene's carbon are fully saturated  they are fixed in position  and there isn't a pathway to link with a carbon from another molecule"
0	"If you want a polymer to be cross-linked  the units have to be polar or at least there should be a functional group that attracts electron from a carbon which the group is binded with. Ethylene is symmetrical molecule only with two carbons connected with double bond and four hydrogens connected to carbons. On the other hand  when we look at one carbon in butadiene we can see that it is connected to at least one group containing double bond which has bigger potential to attract an electron. And as the cross-linking is related to anionic polymerization  this cannot occur in case of non-polar ethylene."

Elastomers are rubbers or rubberlike elastic materials.Thermoplastic polymers are hard at room temperature  but on heating becomesoft and more or less fluid and can be molded. Thermosetting polymers canbe molded at room temperature or above  but when heated more stronglybecome hard and infusible. These categories overlap considerably but arenonetheless helpful in defining general areas of utility and types of structures.The structural characteristics that are most important to determiningthe properties of polymers are: (1) the degree of rigidity of the polymer molecules (2) the electrostatic and van der Waals attractive forces between thechains  (3) the degree to which the chains tend to form crystalline domains and (4) the degree of cross-linking between the chains. Consider a polymer made of a tangle of molecules with long linearchains of atoms. If the intermolecular forces between the chains are small andthe material is subjected to pressure  the molecules will tend to move past oneanother in what is called plastic flow. Such a polymer usually is soluble insolvents that will dissolve short-chain molecules with chemical structuressimilar to those of the polymer. If the intermolecular forces between the chainsare sufficiently strong to prevent motion of the molecules past one another thepolymer will be solid at room temperature  but will usually lose strength andundergo plastic flow when heated. Such a polymer is thermoplastic. A crosslinkis a chemical bond between polymer chains other than at the ends. Crosslinksare extremely important in determining physical properties because theyincrease the molecular weight and limit the translational motions of the chainswith respect to one another. Only two cross-links per polymer chain are requiredto connect all the polymer molecules in a given sample to produce onegigantic molecule. Only a few cross-links  reduce greatly thesolubility of a polymer and tend to produce what is called a gel polymer  which although insoluble  usually will absorb  solvents in which theuncross-linked polymer is soluble.

The double bond can be broken by use of heat and a catalyst and allows a new bond to be formed creating cross linking. The reaction is endothermic. Polyethylene cannot be cross linked because it is formed of long chains of Carbon connected by the double bonded Carbons in CH2 CH2. The reaction is exothermic so it produces a lot of heat. The long chains can be linear or branched but they are terminated by two CH3 groups so they will not cross-link. "

Polymerization is possible by using initiator to withdraw electrons from the double-bonds and create new bonds with the initiator and subsequently with other monomers of the same type. Polybutadiene repeating units have three sites that can be opened up for connection  while polyethylene has only one. So  when connecting one monomer to another the only geometry possible with polyethylene is a long continuous linear chain.

These branches can form other polymer chains or crosslink with other chains. Polyethylene on the other hand is formed from ethene or ethylene which has only one double bond. It cannot be crosslinked because the double bond is used in the initial linear polymerization. No branching occurs."

0	" 1 3-Butadiene is an organic compound that is a simple conjugated diene hydrocarbon (dienes have two carbon-carbon double bonds). Polybutadiene forms by linking many 1 3-butadiene monomers to make a much longer polymer chain molecule. In terms of the connectivity of the polymer chain  butadiene can polymerize in three different ways  called cis  trans and vinyl. The cis and trans forms arise by connecting the butadiene molecules end-to-end  so-called 1 4-polymerisation. The properties of the resulting isomeric forms of polybutadiene differ. For example  high cis-polybutadiene has a high elasticity and is very popular  whereas the so-called high trans is a plastic crystal with few useful application. The vinyl content of polybutadiene is typically no more than a few percent. In addition to these three kinds of connectivity  polybutadienes differ in terms of their branching and molecular weights.The ingredient or monomer is ethylene (IUPAC name ethene). It has the formula C2H4  consisting of a pair of CH2 groups connected by a double bond.Because the catalysts are highly reactive  the ethylene must be of high purity. Typical specifications are <5 ppm for water  oxygen  as well as other alkenes. Acceptable contaminants include N2  ethane (common precursor to ethylene)  and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources  but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol"
0	"To create a cross-linked polymer  one needs a monomer that have at least two double bonds between carbons  one for starting the initiation of polymerization  and the other one for making a cross-link. That's why we can make a cross-linked polymer from polybutadiene  because it's got two double bonds  whereas there are only one double bond on polyethylene"
0	"Cross-linking is possible  if there already are polymolecules (with the lower polymerisation grade) and some reactant  which can cross connect them.  Polyethylene grows its molecules by addition from the monomere. It is initialised  than it can run for a very long molecules and than it is stopped by some stoping condition. If we putted some cross-linking reactant into the polymerization reactor  it would take effect of the terminator of the polymerization."
0	"Since butadiene monomers contain four carbons and two double bonds  they can add to the growing polybutadiene chain in different ways  so that branching is possible. Double bonds left in the branches can react with crosslinking chemicals  which can link the chains between them. This is not possible with polyethylene  since it only contains two carbons and one double bond which is lost when the monomer is added to the chain."

The crosslinking agent will have multiple sites that can react with more then one polymer chain allowing the agent to tie multiple chains together.In polyethylene there are no double bonds to react with. Breaking the carbon to carbon single bond would require much more energy and would break the polymer into small pieces. The carbon to hydrogen bonds are not very reactive sites to try to attack with some type of crosslinking agent."

Polyethylene however with its CH group only provides a single end from where the chain reaction can proceed.

On the other hand polybutadiene has one double bond on each unit which is repeated to create a polymer molecule. So  the active base (initiator) during the polymerization of butadiene can 'attack' a growing chain of polybutadiene at any double bond in it creating cross-links.A polyethylene can be only a line of ethene units."
0	"Polybutadiene can be cross-linked because  the monomer unit in polymer has still a double bond that can be attacked by peroxide  base or cross linker and thus making new polymer radical that can react with another radical or cross-linker.On the other hand polyethylene does not have double bond in its unit's structure and is thus unreactive in this case."

0	"When polymer chains are linked together by crosslinks they lose some of their ability to move as individual polymer chains. A liquid polymer where the chains are freely flowing can be turned into a solid or gel by crosslinking the chains together.In polymer chemistry  when a synthetic polymer is said to be crosslinked  it usually means that the entire bulk of the polymer has been exposed to the crosslinking method. The resulting modification of mechanical properties depends strongly on the crosslink density. Low crosslink densities decrease the viscocities of polymer melts. Intermediate crosslink densities transform gummy polymers into materials that have elastometric properties and potentially high strengths. Very high crosslink densities can cause materials to become very rigid or glassy  such as phenol-formaldehyde materialsCrosslinks can be formed by chemical reactions that are initiated by heat  pressure  change in pH  or radiation.  Mixing of an unpolymerized or partially polymerized resin with specific chemicals called crosslinking reagents results in a chemical reaction that forms crosslinks. Crosslinking can also be induced in materials that are normally thermoplastic through exposure to a radiation source  such as electron beam exposure  gamma-radiation  or UV light.  Electron beam processing is used to crosslink the C type of crosslinked polyethylene. Other types of crosslinked polyethylene are made by addition of peroxide during extruding (type A) or by addition of a crosslinking agent vinylsilane and a catalyst during extruding and then performing a post extrusion curing.The chemical process of vulcanization is a type of crosslinking and it changes the property of rubber to the hard  durable material we associate with car and bike tires. This process is often called sulfur curing  and the term vulcanization comes from Vulcan  the Roman god of fire. However  this is a slow process taking around 8 hours. A typical car tire is cured for 15 minutes at 150C. However  the time can be reduced by the addition of accelerators such as 2-benzothiazolethiol or tetramethylthiuram disulfide. Both of these contain a sulfur atom in the molecule that initiates the reaction of the sulfur chains with the rubber. Accelerators increase the rate of cure by catalysing the addition of sulfur chains to the rubber molecules.Crosslinks are the characteristic property of thermosetting plastic materials. In most cases  crosslinking is irreversible  and the resulting thermosetting material will degrade or burn if heated  without melting. Especially in the case of commercially used plastics  once a substance is crosslinked  the product is very hard or impossible to recycle. In some cases  though  if the crosslink bonds are sufficiently different  chemically  from the bonds forming the polymers  the process can be reversed. Permanent wave solutions  for example  break and reform naturally occurring crosslinks disulfide bonds between protein chains in hair.Physical cross-linksChemical covalent crosslinks are stable mechanically and thermally  so once formed are difficult to break. Therefore  crosslinked products like car tires cannot be recycled easily. A class of polymers known as thermoplastic elastomers rely on physical crosslinks in their microstructure to achieve stability  and are widely used in nontire applications  such as snowmobile tracks  and catheters for medical use. They offer a much wider range of properties than conventional crosslinked elastomers because the domains that act as crosslinks are reversible  so can be reformed by heat. The stabilising domains may be noncrystalline as in styrene-butadiene block copolymers or crystalline as in thermoplastic copolyesters.Oxidative cross-linksMany polymers undergo oxidative crosslinking  typically when exposed to atmospheric oxygen. In some cases this is undesirable and thus polymerization reactions may involve the use of an antioxidant to slow the formation of oxidative crosslinks. In other cases  when formation of crosslinks by oxidation is desirable  an oxidizer such as hydrogen peroxide may be used to speed up the process.The aforementioned process of applying a permanent wave to hair is one example of oxidative crosslinking. In that process the disulfide bonds are reduced  typically using a mercaptan such as ammonium thioglycolate. Following this  the hair is curled and then neutralized. The neutralizer is typically a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide  which causes new disulfide bonds to form under conditions of oxidation  thus permanently fixing the hair into its new configuration.The drawbacks of crooslinked Polyethylene are that the process is expensive and also degradation from sunlight. PEX tubing cannot be used in applications exposed to sunlight  as it degrades fairly rapidly. Prior to installation it must be stored away from sunlight  and needs to be shielded from daylight after installation. Leaving it exposed to direct sunlight for as little as 30 days may result in premature failure of the tubing due to embrittlement.Problems with yellow brass fittings. There have been some claimed PEX systems failures in the U.S.  Canada and Europe resulting in several pending class action lawsuits. The failures are claimed to be a result of the brass fittings used in the PEX system. Generally builders and manufacturers have learned from these experiences and have found the best materials for use in fittings used to connect pipe with connectors  valves and other fittings. But there were problems reported with a specific type of brass fitting used in connection with installations in Nevada which caused a negative interaction between its mineral-rich hard water and so-called yellow brass fittings. Zinc in the fittings leached into the pipe material in a chemical reaction known as dezincification  causing some leaks or blockages. A solution was to replace the yellow brass fittings which had 30% zinc with red brass fittings which had 5% to 10% zinc It led California building authorities to insist on fittings made from red brass which typically has a lower zinc content  and is unlikely to cause problems in the future since problems with these specific fittings have become known.Initial adjustment to a new plumbing system. There were a few reported problems in the early stages as plumbers and homeowners learned to adjust to the new fittings  and when connections were poorly or improperly made  but home inspectors have generally not noticed any problems with PEX since 2000.Can't use adhesives for pipe insulation. One source suggested that pipe insulation  applied to PEX using certain adhesives  could have a detrimental effect causing the pipe to age prematurely; however  other insulating materials can be used such as conventional foam wrap insulation without negative effects.Fittings somewhat more expensive. Generally PEX fittings  particularly the do-it-yourself compression ones  are more expensive than copper ones  although there is no soldering required. Due the flexibility of PEX  it generally requires fewer fittings  which tends to offset the higher cost per fitting.Potential problems for PEX radiant heating with iron-based components. If PEX tubing is used in a radiant heating system which has ferrous radiators or other parts  meaning they are made out of iron or its alloys  then there is the possibility of rust developing over time; if this is the case  then one solution is to have an oxygen barrier in these systems to prevent rust from developing. However  in new installations PEX pipes and iron-based components are not intermixed.Possible health effects. There was controversy in California during the 2000s about health concerns. Several groups blocked adoption of PEX for concerns about chemicals getting into the water  either from chemicals outside the pipes  or from chemicals inside the pipes such as methyl tertiary butyl ether and tertiary butyl alcohol. These concerns delayed statewide adoption of PEX for almost a decade. After substantial back-and-forth legal wrangling which was described as a judicial rollercoaster  the disputing groups came to a consensus  and California permitted use of PEX in all occupancies. An environmental impact report and subsequent studies determined there were no causes for concerns about public health from use of PEX piping.Polybutadiene seems to adapt for a wider range of uses compared to Polyethylene due to it's ability to allow for strengthening by chemical change (cross-linking)"

0	"The difference between the formula units for polybutadiene and polyethylene is that polybutadiene has a double bond in its formula unit between two carbon atoms. Polyethylene does not have this double bond; it is just a long line of carbons with hydrogens on the side. Because polybutadiene has a pi bond  there is room in the bonds to hybridize the p orbital with a base and squeeze in another carbon  thus resulting in the cross-linkage. Polyethylene does not have this capability; one would have to remove a hydrogen entirely in order to attach something."
0	"The carbon polymers  such as polyethylene  consist of C-C bonds along the backbone. The C-C bond length is small: about 1.54 angstroms  and there is not enough room for a radical to replace one of the hydrogen atoms along the sides of the backbone.The polybutadiene polymer consists of siloxane  or Si-O-Si bonds along the backbone. The distance between the silicon atoms is twice the Si-O bond length  or much greater than the C-C bond length  so now there is room for a hydrogen to be replaced by a radical that can form crosslinks between two polymer chains."
0	"I think polyethylene would not be cross linked because the monomer of polyethylene is ethylene/ethene  and it only has one site for reaction  just one double bond and it is linear  so even if something were added it would keep the chain linear. Unlike polyethylene  the monomer for polybutadiene  1 3-Butadiene   has two double bonds. Due to this  there are two sites where other monomers can join  as well other compounds. For example  when Butadiene is used to make tire rubber  sulphur is used for crosslinking  the sulphur can add at one monomer site on one chain of polybutadiene and link it to another."
