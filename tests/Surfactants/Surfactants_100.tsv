0	"Surface tension of water begins to fall when you add surfactant. After more and more surfactant added you get to the CMC (critical micelle concentration)  and surface tension of the solution doesn't change. Why? Because the surfactant is not in the surface anymore stick to the air! now there are enough molecules of surfactant to associate between them. The appearance of the solution from transparent (low concentration of surfactant) becomes opaque because the micelles begin to diffract light."
0	"Surface tension goes down with concentration because there is more surfactant present to use up the free bonds on the surface. At about 0.01% weight the surface tension n longer decreases  instead any additional surfactant goes into making micelles. When micelles form  they are of a size that scatters blue light preferentially  so a bluish color appears on the surface."
0	"Around 0.02%  micelles begin to form. As they do  the surfactant is able to be submerged  and therefore further addition has a less pronounced effect on surface tension.  The solution should begin to appear bluish at this point."
0	"Surface tension reduces when surfactants are added to aqueous solutions. As the concentration of surfactants is increased from 0.0001 weight percent to 0.01 weight percent  the aqueous surface tension reduces sharply until beyond a certain concentration i.e  0.01 weight percent  the effect of the increase in surfactant concentration causes minimal/almost negligible change in aqueous surface tension.The appearance of the solution at 0.001 weight percent versus 1 weight percent will remain relatively the same since at both concentrations  the value of the surface tension is almost the same."
0	"These molecules have lots of C therefore in the .1 concentration the number of surfactant molecules is big enough to change the solution into more surfactant molecules and less water therefore the hydrophabic parts start to gather and the surface tension will reduced."
0	"as the concentration increases the surface tension decreases and after the concentration reaches .05 the drop in surface tension is quite low"
0	"While adding more surfactant molecules the tension goes down. Then  at some point micells start to appear and tension doesn't change. "
0	"At low concentration the number of polar group inside the water per area is gradually increased. Therefore the surface tension decreased. At higher surfactant concentration the surfactant pass the critical point after which it creates micelles that don't affect the surface tension."
0	"As the concentration of the surfactant increases from a low concentration  the surface tension of the solution drops.As the concentration passed the CMC (critical micelle concentration) the change in surface tension drops as the surfactants start to form into micelles.As the micelles start to form  the solution may take on a bluish tint."
0	"The surface tension of a solution drops rapidly until the concentration of a surfactant reaches  .03 wt% which is in this case the CMC and surfactant molecules start to  aggreagate into groups and therefore the surface tension stays pretty much unchanged. Surfactants bond with water molecules but thanks to their hydrophobic parts they completely don't mix (or bond). They bond to surface molecules and therefore reduce the cohesive forces that influence surface water molecules. The solution should seem slightly blueish."
0	"With the addition of surfactants  they form small aggregates of molecules to form micelles  which reduce the surface tension of the liquid.From a certain concentration of micelles - the critical micelle concentration - no longer occurs the formation of such structures  which stabilizes the decrease."
0	"After reaching a certain weight percentage  critical micele conentration  surfactants start to form organised structures called miceles. When this effect occurs  surface tension doesn't change  because if we add a surfactant it won't affect surface tension  it will rather form more miceles.Solution at 1% weight will look a little blueish because of miceles which are making a solution coloidal. At 0.001% weight solution will be clear."
0	"The surface tension drops  since the surfactant molecules assemble as a monomolecular layer at the water air interface. The polar headgroups are facing the water or are solved in the water  whereas the lipophilic tails are exposed to the air. The density of surfactant molecules at the interface increases mtherefore lowering the surface tension until a critical concentration is reached. (The intersection of the two linesof different slope).At this called critical micelle concentration  the surfactant molecules tend to form micelles of nanometerscale that are dispersed in the bulk water instead of being incorporated into the surface layer. Those little particles scatter light  therefore the solution tends to look blueish and depending on the size of the micelles cloudy. A colloid solution is formed."
0	"The surface tension is decreasing with the increasing concentration of surfactant. On LogLin plot the decrease is linear with a given slope. Begining on a certain concetration (here around 0.01 to 0.02 weigth %) the surfactant molecules start to agregate to micelles. That's why from this concentration the slope of surface tension decrease is much lower as the molecules are consumed in micelle creation process. "
0	"The bend in the line is at the concentration for the CMC  or critical micelle point. At this point  micelles start to form in the surfactant. The solution will appear more cloudy or turbid  as the micelles scatter incoming light."
0	"When we increase the concentration of surfactant the surface tension drops until the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached. Above this point  surface tension is roughly constant (about 35 dynas/cm)  so the difference in tension surface at 0.05% and 1% weight is no significant  but if we have a 0.001% concentration  tension is about 45 dynas/cm."
0	"Initially  the surface tension drops rapidly  until it hits a critical point where the drop is less steep. This may be due to some grouping (molecular aggregation) taking place above a certain concentration threshold."
0	"The more surfactants are in the water  the color becomes more blue. Its becouse the blue light diffracts on the big molecules"
0	"The surface tension decreases as the concentration of the surfactant molecule increases. However  when the surfactant concentration is increased beyond about 0.02 percent weight  there is hardly no change in surface tension. This is a consequence of micelle formation.At 0.001 percent weight the solution will be clear. When the concentration is equal to 1  the micelles will disperse light  so the solution will be turbid."
0	"In the low percentage zone the micelles are actively forming  until the point of about 0.03 is reached  from where on the solvent stays rather stable and much less new structures form and this phase should be less transparent then low percentage solvent."
0	" When  light >> then particle diameter like in the sky or micelles   Rayleigh scattering dominates. The amount of scattering is a function of wavelength ( proportional to (1/)^4) so shorter wave lengths like blue being scattered the most.If   diameter (like in clouds) then Mie theory scattering dominates where all  are scattered equally and the scattered light appears white.if  << then diameter (like in raindrops) then geometric optics dominates and we get effects like rainbows from refraction."
0	"As surfactant is initially added to water  the surface tension decreases due to the surfactant molecules aligning at the air water interface  with the polar end dissolving in the water  the non polar end in the air. This reduces the strength of the water hydrogen bonds up to the Critical Micelle Concentration of around 0.015wt% surfactant in water.  As the concentration increases further  the surfactant forms micelles  ordered structures of surfactant with the non polar groups at the center  the polar groups facing the water.  These may be spherical  tubular or lamellar in shape.Up to the CMC  the solution will be clear  above the CMC it may become hazy  with a blueish color as the micelles form and scatter light (blue more so than red)."
0	"Surfactant molecule has hydrophobic section and a hydrophilic section.when a surfactant is placed on the surface of water  the hydrophilic end is attracted to the water and immerses itself in the H2O whilst the hydrophobic section will tend to try to get as far away from the H2O as posssible.At the lowest concentrations  the immersion of the hydrophilic section of the surfactant in the H2O will act to reduce the surface tension of the water.  As the conc of the surfactant increases  the surface tension lowering effect increases in proportion to the increase in conc of surfactant.The carries on until a critical surfactant concentration is reached.  At the Critical Surfactant Concentration (CSC)  the surfactants clump together and form micelles.Micelles: a 3-d structure made of clumps of surfactants with solid/concentrated walls  where the hydrophobic ends group together and the hydrophilic ends line up side by side.  The interesting thing about a micelle is that only a fraction of the surfactant molecules are in contact with the water at any time  so an increase in surfactant concentration above the Critical Surfactant Concentration (when micelles are forming) results in a smaller decrease in H2O surface tension than an equivalent increase in surfactant conc below the CSC.At  0.001 weight percent micelles have not formed and the appearance of of the soln will be one of clear water; at  1 weight percent micelles have formed and the soln will have a blueish appearance."
0	"As the concentration grows it reaches the CMC and the molecules arrange themselves in spherical micelles. The spherical arrangement is the toughest to be squeezed under pressure  thus we observe a big grow in the internal tension. At 0.0001 it will be a clear solved solution. At 1 it will became cloggy and we will be able to see small droplets no the surface or even a homogenous layer. "

0	"From the data of the plot of surface tension against the weight percent of surfactant  it shoes that the surface tension decreases progressively with increase in surfactant concentration as clearly depicted by the steep slope of the graph from a surfactant weight percent of 0.001 to about 0.038/0.04. and we notice from the second plot that beyond this point the slope becomes very small in other words very less steep. this can be accounted for by the formation of micelles. at this point the surfactant molecules are said to organise themselves to the fullest(CMC). Further increase in the concentration or weight percent in this context has little effect on the surface tension. as the weight percent approaches 1% there is physical observation  and this is seen as solution changes to a colour that scatters light. beyond this point  there is no effect on the surface tension."
0	"At the critical point in the graph the surfactants form micelles. The micelles will maintain nearly equal surface tension since they are now organizing themselves into spheres or other shapes.The appearance of the solution at .1 should start to appear cloudy rather than clear."

0	"Surfactant molecules have hydrophilic heads  which immerse themselves in water  and hydrophobic tails  which stick out of the water. The tails cause the molecules to remain at the surface of the water  while the heads reduce surface tension in the water  by adding attractive forces at the surface to counter those from deeper within the water. As more surfactant is added to the water  the surface tension will decrease  as shown in the above graph  until at a certain concentration  shown by the intersection of the two lines on the graph  the surfactant molecules begin bonding together  forming structures known as micelles  with the heads of the molecules on the outside and the tails on the inside  preventing the surface tension from falling as quickly. This can result in the mixture becoming bluish  as may be happening beyond the intersection point."
0	"at 0.001 WP  the surfacants stay (float) at the air/water boundry  with the hydrophilic head stick in the water and hydrophobic tail stick toward the air; and the pull of the head at the water served to reduce the surface tension.As the concentration increases  at about 0.02 WP  micelles with a hydrophlic outer shell start to form and become  submersible  therefore additional surfacants will not reduce the surface tension by much.So at 0.001 WP  the solution should just look normal; at 1WP  micelles should be observed under microscope  and the solution may have a hue associated with it  given th lighting condition is right  because of the scattering effect of the tiny miecell particles. "
0	"The graph shows that the surface tension clearly decreases until the percentage of surfactant reaches 0.2 approximately. At this point  the molecules are dispersed  for example if the surfactant percentage is 0 001  there are not enough molecules to form micelles.The surface tension drops to 35 dynes / cm. At this point about descends very little with increasing the surfactant percentage. This is because the cmc point was reached.  So when the surfactant percentaje is 1  molecules have formed micelles"
0	"At low concentrations  there is hight surface tension and they al accumulate on the surface  after a while  there will be a decrease in surface tension accompanied by self assembly of the surfactants beyond the critical micelle concentration."

It causes some bodies may float on the water surface in spite of being more dense than it  the formation of water droplets on waxed surfaces or meniscus formed in cylindrical containers  that are also a result of the polarity of the molecule."

0	"The solution at 0.001 weight percent is below the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) so the surfactant will form a thin layer on the surface with the hydrophilic section in the water and hydrophobic section sticking out of the water. The layer will most likely be transparent and clear.The solution at 1 weight percent is above the CMC so the surfactant will aggregate to form micelles which will appear as  a bluish tint."
0	"Roughly after 0.01 wt%  the solution is saturated with the surfactant  which makes the surfactant molecules to aggregate  forming micelles. The higher the concentration after the saturation point  the higher the quantity of micelles  which begin to scatter light and change the appearance of the solution from transparent to whitish to bluish at very high concentrations."
0	"The surface tension decreases in proportion to the log of the weight percent of surfactant up to a weight percent of .02.  After this point the surface tension is largely insensitive to the increase in weight percent up to 1.  This indicates that above .02 weight percent  the surfactant molecules are forming micelles and will be visible as a bluish tinge.  At lower percentages  the molecules are largely independent and just take up room on the surface of the water and affect surface tension colligatively."

0	"The ability of surfactants to reduce surface tension of water to a low value is a fundamental characteristic which results in highly efficient and effective performance in a wide range of applications. By changing the surface tension of a solution  the surfactant solution becomes wet better. Instead of beading up  the solution will spread on the surface or penetrate more rapidly into fibers.Surfactants changing the surface tension of water  breaking up the forces holding the water molecules along the interface. The surface tension is generally expressed dynes / cm or mN / m. Two measures surface tension generally carried provide two different types of data.Equilibrium surface tension (typically an aqueous surfactant solution) indicates the effectiveness of a surfactant is to reduce the surface tension of water (72 dynes / cm). For example  an aqueous 0.1% Tergitol TMN-6 (90%) of surfactant has an equilibrium surface tension of 26 dyne / cm  indicating excellent wetting properties.Enter essay here."
0	"The surfactant initially forms a surface layer on the top of the water. This reduces the surface tension of the water-surfactant mixture. As the concentration is increased there are more surfactant molecules per area of the surface  this continues to reduce the surface tension of the mixture. Once the critical micelle concentration is reached  the surface has become saturated in surfactant. Adding addition surfactant now begins to form micelles suspended in the mixture. The change in surface tension with increased surfactant now becomes much smaller. As the micelles approach the size of visible light  Rayleigh scattering happens and the blue light is scattered more giving the mixture a blue tint. As the surfactant concentration is increases  more micelles form increase the amount of light scattered and the turbidity of the mixture increases. "
0	"The solution will differ at 0.001 weight percent and 1 weight because of the micelles. The micelles disperse color  so with less micelles  the less the solution will look blue  while the more micelles there are  the more blue it will look."
0	"On the surface  the interactions with the neighboring molecules are limited and weaker  resulting in a higher free energy and reduced inter-molecular hydrogen bonding of the molecules.This causes the high surface tension at 0.001% wt of surfactant.At 1% wt  the bonds of water molecules in the surface are saturated which lower the free energy which lower the surface tension.."
0	"Surface tension declines as surfactant is added because the hydrophilic ends of the surfactant molecules disrupt the intermolecular attractions among the surface water molecules.  As the concentration of surfactant reaches the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  from the graph at just below 0.02 percent by weight  the surfactant begins to form micelles  which disperse into the water  causing it to become turbid.  Little further change is observed in the surface tension beyond this point."

0	"Initially  at a concentration of 0.0001  the surfactant molecule is situated on the surface of the solution.  The hydrophobic tails sticking out into the air.  As the concentration increases thee surface tension decreases until a critical point is reached at which point the surfactants spontaneously form into micelles.   As the concentration increases the surface tension of the micelles remains relatively constant."
0	"The surface tension rises when we add a small amount of surfactant. While we continue adding surfactant the surface tension is still growing up. When we reach a certain concentration  surface tension doesn't change because the surfactant is forming micelles."
0	"The surface tension decreases because of surfactants forming bonds on the surface of water. However  as surfactants are added to excess  they start to aggregate themselves in the solution. Since the aggregated surfactants do not contribute (or less) to the mechanism  the surface tension does not rise further. On other side  the aggregation of molecules form various bodies which are large enough to scatter light. Therefore  at 0.001 weight percent  the solution remains clear  while at 0.1 weight percent  it appears blurry."
0	"The solubility is increasing.  Also  water tension appears to be decreasing. "
0	"At first  the surface tension of the water is quickly dropping  as a result of the hydrophilic ends of the surfactants immersing themselves in the water  and disrupting the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules that gives water its high surface tension. Then  at approximately .0175% weight the concentration of surfactants has reached a point where there are enough of them to begin spontaneously form micelles  which are organizations of surfactant molecules  usually spheres  with the hydrophobic ends facing inwards and the hydrophilic ends facing outwards  towards the water. The micelles now have the ability to completely submerge in the water  as the hydrophobic ends create an outer shell which protect the inner hydrophilic ends from being exposed in the water  even when fully submerged. After this  the rate at which the surface tension of the water drops greatly decreases  as the majority of additional surfactant does not stay on the surface and disrupt hydrogen bonds there  but instead forms micelles which are fully submerged in the water.The appearance of the solution at 1 percent wt concentration will have a colored hue  usually bluish  as a result of the micelles. The micelles  which are scattered throughout the water  will be at a concentration at which they will refract and bend light  changing the color of the solution. This does not occur at 0.001 percent wt concentration  because the surfactant molecules are too few and far between to begin forming micelles. "
0	" The trend of the change in the surface tension changes when the concentration of surfactants arrives in the critical micelle concentration  at this point  the surface tension stops decreasing and keeps constant. In the points before the CMC  like in the point where the weight percent is equal to 0.001  you can't observe micelles so  the turbidity is equal 0. In the points after the CMC  like in the point where the weight percent is equal to 1  you can observe micelles so  the turbidity is greather than 0  because the micelles present in the solution can scatter the light."
0	"As more surfactant is added  the pulling apart force is less as it is easier to spread out across the entire surface. That being said  the molecules are a lot more concentrated and will have a blue tint because science says so."
0	"The surface tension is decreasing as concentration increases because the surfactant is trying to get to organize to form micelles. The lowest point in surface tension in the CMC and micelles start forming. The solution can be clear at 0.001 weight percent  but cloudy at 1 percent weight because  at this higher concentration there will be a good number of micelles and they will disperse light. "
0	"This the answer."
0	"Surface tension lowers as the weight percent increases. As you add more and more of the surfactants  it interferes with the stratification and naturally aggregates. More light will be scattered at 1 % than .0001 because of these aggregants."
0	"Surface tension decreases with increasing of weight percent until it gets the solubility limit  and then by adding more surfactant  concentration is approximattely the same."
0	"The left part of the curve shows a steady decrease in surface tension as surfactant is added due to the effect of surfactant at the water-air interface. As more of the surfactant spreads over the surface  it continues to lower the surface tension. At the CMC  the surfactant starts to organize into micelles so that surface tension no longer continues to be lowered and stabilizes."
0	"Below the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  the solution will be clear. The solution will be turbid above the CMC as the micelles will scatter light."
0	"The surface tension reduces until the surfactants are clumped together at a critical point. When this happens the clump will influence the surface tension differently than the dispersed surfactants because of the difference in conformation of the molecules. As the weight percentage increases the solution will acquire a bluish tint."
0	"Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules with hydrophobic head at one end and hydrophilic head another end. On addition of such a surfactant to water  it lowers the surface tension of the water. The hydrophilic end gets attached to the water while the hydrophobic end points away towards the air or towards other non-polar particles present.It is the general rule that as the concentration of the surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. In the graph it is evident that as the concentration of the surfactant increase  the surface tension decreases  so the line is slopping down. In the graph after certain concentration  the line becomes a plateau.   This is because  after a particular point there is no change in surface tension with increase in concentration of the surfactant. What happen here is that all the molecules aggregates together spontaneously to form micelles. After this critical micelles concentration (CMC)  there is no change in surface tension with addition of surfactants. That is the reason why the plot goes straight after a continuous decrease until certain concentration. If the graph was plotted with 0.001% Vs 1% weight  the shape of the graph would remain the same. But the line would be starting from a surface tension below 50 and will decrease continuously until the same point on the original plot and then the surface tension would remain constant giving straight line parallel to the X axis  as in the original plot since the CMC remains the same. "
0	"When adding surfactants  surface tension is decreasing  up to a point - critical micelle point - where surfactants form structures with the hydrophobic group in the middle  and hydrophilic group in the center. After that point  surface tension won't change by much. Solution at a concentration of 0.001 weight percent will be clear  but at 1  it will be cloudy."
0	"As the weight percent of the surfancant increases  the surface tension decreases. This is because the surfactant segregates to the surface of the aqueous solution. Once the weight percent reaches the critical micelle concentration  the surfactant molecules begin aggregating into micelles and no longer affect the surface tension."

Surface tension is usually expressed dynes/cm or mN/m. Two surface tension measurements commonly performed provide two different types of data.Equilibrium surface tension (typically of an aqueous surfactant solution) indicates how effective a surfactant is at reducing the surface tension of water (72 dynes/cm). For example  a 0.1% aqueous solution of TERGITOL TMN-6 (90%) Surfactant has an equilibrium surface tension of 26 dynes/cm  which indicates excellent wetting properties.Dynamic surface tension measures how rapidly a surfactant reduces the surface tension of a solution."
0	"The surfactant allows the decrease of the surface tension because they replace solvent molecules on the surface  which were originally strongly bonded. Since the intermolecular interactions of the surfactant molecules are weak  it's relatively easy to increase the surface area. However  there is a critical concentration (CMC) where the surfactant molecules start to aggregate  forming micelles  and the lowering of the surface tension is roughly stopped."

But  whene concentration is higher than about 0.2wt% surface tension is not decreased so much or almost constant. Because then the solution is sarturated and these sphere connnect each other.

At this point concentration is called CMC.In the given figure at 0.001 weight percentage surface tension is about 50 dynes/cm which further goes down with increase in weight percentage of surfactant upto weight percentage of approximately 0.011 & 35 dynes/cm of surface tension.After this point any further addition of surfactant does not reduce surface tension any further but starts formation of aggregates. This status continues even at a weight percentage of 1 also.Thus at weight percentage of 0.001 surface tension has a decreasing trend   however  at weight percentage of 1 & further more no decrease in surface tension is observed this is because further to CMC value surfactants starts making aggregates."

In a solublization flood  the total aqueous solubility of the contaminant is increased such that the dissolution process becomes more efficient. Physical mobilization of the residual and pooled NAPL may be undesirable in a solubilization flood. Rather  the goal of a solubilization flood is to dissolve away residual and pooled NAPL in fewer pore volumes than would be required by natural groundwater flow or pump-and-treat systems alone. As surfactants are added to aqueous solution  they will tend to accumulate at fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces. Some surfactant monomers also will exist in free solution in all phases present. Once a sufficient amount of surfactant has been added to aqueous solution  however  aggregations of surfactant monomers referred to as micelles will form. Micelles are often spherical in shape and can contain several hundred surfactant monomers. The threshold concentration at which micelles begin to form is termed the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Beyond the CMC  any surfactant added to aqueous solution will not increase the number of monomers in aqueous solution  but rather will contribute to the formation of additional micelles. "

0	"- Adding surfactant to an aqueous solution will decrease its surface tension because the hydrophobic tails of molecules of this surfactant will stick out of the surface of the aqueous solution and partially screen the tendency of the surface molecules of the aqueous solution to attract and bond to each other.- The surface tension of the aqueous solution will be constant after a certain weight percent of surfactant is reached(nearly 0.01). At this point  the screening effect of the surfactant is maximum and micelles begin to form.- 0.001 wt% is relatively clear because it doesn't contain micelles (macro-molecules).- 1 wt% is turbid because it contains micelles (macr-molecules) that are big enough to scatter light."

Further increase in concentration may cause the orientation and close packing of the elongated micelles into hexagonal arrays; this is a liquid crystalline state termed the middle phase or hexagonal phase. With some surfactants  further increase of concentration results in the separation of a second liquid crystalline state  the neat phaseor lamellar phase.In some surfactant systems another liquid crystalline state  the cubic phase  occurs between the middle and neat phases."

0	"In this graph it shows that as concentration of a surfactant increases the surface tension decreases. This is because the surfactant has a hydrophobic end that sticks out of the water and a hydrophilic portion that reacts with the water. This scenario decreases surface tension until the critical point where the graph changes slope dramatically where an increase in the surfactant has little effect on surface tension. At .0001 concentration the small concentration of the surfactant is not large enough to effect surface tension  but as it is added to solution it decreases the surface tension dramatically. At 1 wt% the surfactant is past the critical micelle point where the surfactant starts to organize and the surfactant does not affect surface tension."

And it gets a little bluish tinge because of the way light scatters atdifferent wavelengths. And these can form aggregates  all kinds of complexity these surfactants."
0	"When the percentage increases  the surface tension diminishes in the left part  until it saturates."
0	"Because it becomes dense a 1 and light passes thru diffentlly."
0	"At low concentrations (approximately below 0.01%) surfactant will seggregate to the surface of the water  and its hydrophilic end will stay in contact with the surface of water  lowering its surface tension. Surface tension lowers to a limit with increasing concentration of the surfactant. That limit is the CMC (Critical Micelles concentration)  for concentrations above that limit the surfactant will start forming micelles  and thus the increasing on the effect on surface tension will stop. Above the CMC surface tension remains almost constant because any increase inthe concentration of surfacttant will form micelles  will not seggregate to the surface. Those micelles  with diameters between 3 and 50 nanometers  will scatter light passing through the solution  making water white or blue."
0	"Enter essay here.When we add  surfactant  to the aqueous solution surface tension decreases.At a particular concentration the micells  are formed and that particular concentration is called critical micell concentration. After that by adding surfactant the surface tension remains basically unchanged. At 0.001 there is no color.But at 1 wt% the solution has bluish color."

0	"From the graph we see that adding surfactant decreases the surface tension. The surfactant forms secondary bonds with water at its surface  hence decreasing overall bond energy and surface energy  therefore decreasing surface tension. At some point there's a kink in the graph - this is at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) at which micelles begin to form. Micelles are accumulations of surfactants  with the hydrophilic group pointing out of the micelle and the hydrophobic group pointing in to the micelle. Within concentrations over the CMC  variations in surface tension are small because surfactants in a micelle can be anywhere in the water and not just on the surface."
0	"As weight percent of surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases because the surfactant bonds to the surface reducing the energy of the unbonded surface molecules.  At some critical point however the surface becomes saturated with surfactant and addition of more surfactant results in formation of micelles which leave the surface and enter the bulk fluid.  So at 0.001 weight percent  the surface has very little surfactant and high surface tension  but at 1 weight percent  the surface is saturated and the solution has micelles in it."
0	"Through hydrophobic part couples trying to reach the surface  reducing the surface tension  but at a certain concentration of vapor form micelles because the surface tension does not change."
0	"As more and more surfactants are added  the surface tension decreases. At a certain point  however  the surface tension stops decreasing at the same rate. It is at that point  around .01 weight percent in this case  that the surfactants begin to form an aggragate. At .001 weight percent  the solution will look clear. Meanwhile  at 1 weight percent  the solution will contain dispersed aggragates  showing a scattering of light."
0	"The surfactant will not be dissolved at .001 weight percent   but will be dissolved into the water at 1 weight percent.  There has to be enough surfactant to lower the surface tension on the water to the point where the surfactant will dissolve into the water."
