The surface tension of an aqueous solution of a surfactant molecule is measured as a function of concentration. The data is shown below in a plot of surface tension vs. weight percent surfactant. In a few sentences explain what is happening and why. How will the appearance of the solution differ at 0.001 weight percent versus 1 weight?
