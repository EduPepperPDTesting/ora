In a solublization flood  the total aqueous solubility of the contaminant is increased such that the dissolution process becomes more efficient. Physical mobilization of the residual and pooled NAPL may be undesirable in a solubilization flood. Rather  the goal of a solubilization flood is to dissolve away residual and pooled NAPL in fewer pore volumes than would be required by natural groundwater flow or pump-and-treat systems alone. As surfactants are added to aqueous solution  they will tend to accumulate at fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces. Some surfactant monomers also will exist in free solution in all phases present. Once a sufficient amount of surfactant has been added to aqueous solution  however  aggregations of surfactant monomers referred to as micelles will form. Micelles are often spherical in shape and can contain several hundred surfactant monomers. The threshold concentration at which micelles begin to form is termed the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Beyond the CMC  any surfactant added to aqueous solution will not increase the number of monomers in aqueous solution  but rather will contribute to the formation of additional micelles. "
0	"First of all  adding more surfactant molecules  the surface tension is decreasing as more molecules are being added. But there exist a CMC point somewhere between .01 & .1 wt. percent. After which micelle formation begins and addition of more surfactants do not decrease surface tension."
0	"As the concentration grows it reaches the CMC and the molecules arrange themselves in spherical micelles. The spherical arrangement is the toughest to be squeezed under pressure  thus we observe a big grow in the internal tension. At 0.0001 it will be a clear solved solution. At 1 it will became cloggy and we will be able to see small droplets no the surface or even a homogenous layer. "
0	"The change is due to the onset of aggregation which takes place at a certain concentration of surfactant. Above the CMC the solution becomes turbid."
0	"At low concentration the number of polar group inside the water per area is gradually increased. Therefore the surface tension decreased. At higher surfactant concentration the surfactant pass the critical point after which it creates micelles that don't affect the surface tension."
0	"The surface tension decreases as more surfactant is added until it hits the critical point.  At this point  the molecules start to aggregate so the surface tension will remain fairly constant.  The solution will start to take on a blueish  hue after the critical point due to light scattering  so the solution will be bluish at 1 weight percent versus 0.001 weight percent."
0	"It forms a micelle"
0	"The solution at 1% will be very turbid compared to the solution at 0.001% because the critical point  the point where the surface tension essentially plateaus  is shown to be around 0.015%. After the critical point  the turbidity rises. When a surfactant is added to a polar solvent like water  the hydrophilic heads are exposed the water while the hydrophobic tails point away from the water. This causes the surface tension to lower until the concentration reaches a point  the critical points  at which the surfactant begins to form structures like micelles and tubes."
0	"Adding surfactant to water decrease surface tension until reach crytical micelle concentration. At this point  surfactant start forming micelles and  micelles scatter light. Up to crytical micelle concentration turbidity appear  and increasing surfactant concentration turbidity increase.  Thats why  0.001 weight  solution its clear and 1 weight its blue like  differing the appearence of the soluton"
0	"The introduction of surfactant to the solution lowers the surface tension by forming micelles in it  with the polar head directed to water and the apolar tail directed to the apolar component. On this way  at 1 weight percent of surfactant  a point after the critical micelle concentration  the appearance of the solution is like only one phase was present  instead of two (at 0.001 weight percent)."
0	"As more and more surfactants are added  the surface tension decreases. At a certain point  however  the surface tension stops decreasing at the same rate. It is at that point  around .01 weight percent in this case  that the surfactants begin to form an aggragate. At .001 weight percent  the solution will look clear. Meanwhile  at 1 weight percent  the solution will contain dispersed aggragates  showing a scattering of light."
0	"The surface tension decreases in proportion to the log of the weight percent of surfactant up to a weight percent of .02.  After this point the surface tension is largely insensitive to the increase in weight percent up to 1.  This indicates that above .02 weight percent  the surfactant molecules are forming micelles and will be visible as a bluish tinge.  At lower percentages  the molecules are largely independent and just take up room on the surface of the water and affect surface tension colligatively."
0	"As a rule increasing the concentration of  surfactants will decrease the surface tension. but after some critical point named as CMC Micelles are going to be constructed and this is because we see no such a change in surface tension. "
0	"As the concentration of surfactant increases as a function of wt % of water (presumed) solution  the surface tension is decreases until it reaches the critical micelle concentration  at which point there is minimal subsequent effect. this occurs because the hydrophobic component of the surfactant seeks the water interface  and separates itself from the water  while the hydrophilic portion remains in the water. The surfactant decreases the surface energy portion of the surface tension  thus lowering the surface tension. The presence of the surfactant also scatters light due to light diffraction . This causes the surface to have a slight bluish tint to an observer."
0	"As soon as the critical micelle concentration is reached  in which enough surfactant is dissolved in the given substance  the surface tension is minimized because micelles begin to form which minimize surface area and effectively the tension... which hardly changes with increased volume after the cmc. At .001 wt %  the substance will not appear fully dissolved (it will appear non-uniform and will probably form layers); however  at .1 wt %  dissolution will be more effective because the cmc has already been reached...therefore the surfact will have fully dissolved the substance and it will appear uniform - distinctions between substances or layers will be virtually unnoticeable for the most part. "
0	"The number of micelles increases from .001 to 1 %  with the colour of the solution going a pale blue as the % increases"
0	"The solution becomes turbid because of the formation of micelles"

0	"In solution during increasing concentration of surfactant at some point (in shown diagramm at approximately .011 wt%) concentration of surfactant is anought to create micelles. So that point matches MC. Below that point solution will be bluish (because of scattering) Above this point solution will be turbid (because of micelles) "
0	"While adding more and more surfactant the surface tension decreases until it reaches the cmc-point (=point of critical micelle concentration). This is reached where th two lines in the diagram cross. At cmc the surfactants start to aggregate spontaneousely and form micelles. Because micelles consist of many surfactants  each  they scatter the light differently and the color of the aqueous solution will turn into bluishat 1wt%. At .0001 wt% the color of the solution is transparent."
0	"Around 0.02%  micelles begin to form. As they do  the surfactant is able to be submerged  and therefore further addition has a less pronounced effect on surface tension.  The solution should begin to appear bluish at this point."
0	"Enter essay here.As the concentration of the substance increases the surface tension decreases. "
0	"Initially  the surface tension drops rapidly  until it hits a critical point from where the drop becomes less steep. This may be due to some grouping (molecular aggregation) taking place above a certain concentration threshold."
0	"The surfactant gathers on the surface  and up until a critical point as surfactant is added it breaks up the surface tension  and so the surface tension steadily goes down significantly as more and more is added.At about 0.015  there are enough surfactant molecules on the surface that they start forming micelle structures. Adding more just grows the micelles and so the rate of surface tension lowering drops to almost zero.The micelles affect light transmission/reflection  and so there should be changes in color of the surface when there are a lot of them  such as when the weight percentage is 1%. When there are very few surfactants  they won't have much if any affect on the appearance."
0	"The surfactant consists of two different structural parts  an alliphatic  non-polar chain  that is hydrophobic  and a polar group  that is hydrophilic. The hydrophobic part of the molecule sticks out of the water and the hydrophilic is in the water. As surface tension is a result of interaction of the water molecules  this interaction is hindered by the surfactant molecules."
0	"As the concentration percentage of the surfactant increases  the surface tension of the solution decreases. The surfactant acts to neutralize the forces of interaction between the molecules  thereby decreasing surface tension. There is a steep and steady decrease until the concentration is between 0.01 and 0.1%. The appearance of the solution will not change as much as its characteristics  since insects like the water strider will no longer be able to walk on its surface if the solution has a lower surface tension than water."

0	"As the weight percent of surfactant increases to a certain point called the critical micelle concentration or c.m.c.  the surface tension decreases. This is because the surfactant molecules align themselves at the surface  with their hydrophilic ends pointing into the solution and forming bonds with water molecules that would otherwise be at the surface and therefore less bonded. Above the c.m.c.  about 0.02 weight percent in this case  the surfactant begins to form micelles. As these are suspended within the solution and not necessarily at the surface  the surface tension does not decrease much as concentrations are increased beyond this point. The presence of micelles will give solutions with a concentration greater than the c.m.c. a turbid  somewhat bluish appearance whereas solutions with a concentration less than the c.m.c. will have no micelles and will be clear."
0	"As surfactant is added  the surface tension of water drops proportionally to the concentration of the surfactant. Initially  the surfactant molecules break up some of the bonds the surface  decreasing both surface energy and surface tension. At a certain concentration of surfactant  the solution reaches the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  where the surfactant molecules self-aggregate  forming structures known as micelles. The micelles do not have much effect on surface tension  which is why the surface tension remains essentially flat above the CMC.The solution will be transparent at .001 weight percent  while it will be cloudy and bluish at 1 percent  with the micelles in the solution scattering light."
0	"- Surfactants are compounds that reduce the surface tension of water.- A surfactant molecule is amphiphilic and interferes with the hydrogen bonding in water and reduces the cohesiveness.- The more the surfactant  less the surface tension. - As surfactant wight percent increases  the surface tension reduces. At .001 wt% the surface tension is very high whereas at 1 wt% it is low. This is due to more interference with hydrogen bonds in water. "
0	"Initially the surface tension is decreasing as the surfactant molecules are on the air water interface. After a while we reach a point when the concentration start staying constant this is when the surfactant molecules have started forming micelles. "
0	"The surfactants lower the surface tension of liquid  in our case it is water. And what we see on the diagram is just that. In the presence of the greater surfactant concentration  the surface tension lowers  and it is the lowest when the surfactant concentration is 1%  and vice versa."
0	"At the crossing point  the concentration of the surfactant molecule is sufficient that it aggregates into a structure such as a liposome or a micelle.  At this point  the impact on surface tension becomes markedly less."
0	"As the concentration of the surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases significantly until it remains almost constant. The surfactant disrupts the bonds on the surface of the liquid and so decreases the surface tension. When the concentration of the surfactant reaches a high enough value where the surfactant molecules can aggregate into structures such as Micelles and Liposomes  at which time there is no net reduction in surface tension.At 1% concentration  the mixture will appear slightly blue and more opaque than at 0.15 concentration."
0	"The surface tension decreases until a critical concentration of surfactant is reached. When that critical concentration is reached  then the surfactant will start creating micelle structures which will not decrease the surface tension in at the same rate as the surfactant that is not in this configuration because the surfactant in this arrangement does not cover as much surface area as it does not in this configuration."
0	"Enter essay here.When concentrarion of surfuctant molecule increases  the Aqueous surface tension decrease. It is caused of the  surfactant molecules aggregate and form sphere shaped objects. These spheres deduct surface tension because the innner parts of these are carbon chaines(oilphilic) and outer parts  are hydrophilic. But  whene concentration is higher than about 0.2wt% surface tension is not decreased so much or almost constant. Because then the solution is sarturated and these sphere connnect each other. So  the solution of1wt% has more viscousity than the solution of 0.001wt%  and we can apper it is almost pure sufactant.  "
0	"The surfactant  with the hydrophilic group  reduces water surface tension to a certain point - CMC - which they start forming micelles. Further added surfactant yields nothing. "
0	"The surface tension reduces until the surfactants are clumped together at a critical point. When this happens the clump will influence the surface tension differently than the dispersed surfactants because of the difference in conformation of the molecules. As the weight percentage increases the solution will acquire a bluish tint."
0	"The ability of surfactants to reduce the surface tension of water to a low value is a fundamental characteristic that results in highly efficient and effective performance in a wide range of applications. By changing the surface tension of a solution  the surfactant makes the solution wet better. Instead of beading upre.Surfactants change the surface tension of water by breaking up the forces holding the water molecules together at the interface. Surface tension is usually expressed dynes/cm or mN/m. Two surface tension measurements commonly performed provide two different types of data.Equilibrium surface tension (typically of an aqueous surfactant solution) indicates how effective a surfactant is at reducing the surface tension of water (72 dynes/cm). For example  a 0.1% aqueous solution of TERGITOL TMN-6 (90%) Surfactant has an equilibrium surface tension of 26 dynes/cm  which indicates excellent wetting properties.Dynamic surface tension measures how rapidly a surfactant reduces the surface tension of a solution."
0	"As the weight percent of surfactant is increased  the surface tension starts decreasing steeply first and thereafter it starts decreasing slowly. Surface tension decreases as we can think of it as more amphiphiles come to the solution the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile attaches with the polar part of the solution hence decreasing the resistance(polar particles) from the solution.The appearance of solution at 0.0001 weight percent as compared to that at 1 weight % will be more viscous and maybe less turbid to the 1 weight % solution."
0	"The solution will appear 'cloudy' at 1.  The domain has shifted from a surface phenomenon to an aggregation phenomenon."
0	"From 0.0001 to 0.01 the molecule of surfactant are dispersed on the aqueous solution  and suface tension diminishes.After 0.01 these surfactant molecules assembly themselves to form micelles and the surface tension stays almost constant.At 0.001 the aqueous solution is transparent after at 1 with the formation of micelles  aqueous solution is blushy (sorry for the word) i.e. not so transparent..."
0	"Micelle formation at CMC of ~0.15 wt% surfactant. The solution will start to appear cloudy as the wt% surfactant is increased from 0.001 wt% to 1 wt%."
0	"As surfactant is added to the solution  it congregates on the surface where the hydrophilic groups of the molecules stick into the water and the hydrophobic groups stick out of it.  The presence of these molecules lower the surface tension by taking up surface space.  This decreasing trend continues until the critical micelle concentration is reached.  Once the solution becomes this concentrated  the surfactant molecules begin to group together in spherical  plane  or rod-shaped  particles.  Therefore  as more surfactant is added  more groups together into micelles  so the surface tension beyond this point stays basically the same.The solution would be clear at .0001 weight percent. At 1 weight percent  the surfactants have gathered into micelles which may be up to 50 nanometers wide.  Because of their size  they refract some light.  This usually gives the solution a blue tinge."
0	"The surface tension rises when we add a small amount of surfactant. While we continue adding surfactant the surface tension is still growing up. When we reach a certain concentration  surface tension doesn't change because the surfactant is forming micelles."
0	"The surface tension drops down constantly until it reaches the certain point in this case around 35 dymes/cm when aqueous solution begins to form micells. At the certain weight percentage it is more energetically profitable to form micells  organized structure  rather than stay i chaotic configuration. The appearance will change  on the surface there will be observable circles  which are the sign of micells presence "
0	"In the field of concentration since 0 till 0.01% surface tension are decreasing in linear proportionaluty with increasing of concentration. But in Critical concentration of Micell (CMC) no tension change observed."
0	"Adding a surfactant we reduce surface tension. Surfactant adsorbs on a surface layer and decrease a surface tension. In some point of .02 concentration saturated surface layer of surfactant is generated. Further extra adding of surfactant doesn't effect surface tension notably."
0	"As the weight percentage increases the surface tension decreases as expected. However    after a particular point  the surface tension starts decreasing at a slower rate. This anomaly can be explained by the fact that after reaching a particular concentration  the molecules of the surfactant start forming molecular aggregations like micelles  liposomes  and bilayers.  At 0.0001% the solution will appear quite clear  whereas at 1  the solution would appear cloudy."
0	"Surfactants contains amphiphilies which contains polar water soluble end & other end with non polar tails which is non water loving & do not dissolve in water.When surfactant is added to water solution  it's surface tension starts  decreasing.At a certain point further addition of surfactant does not reduce surface tension any further.At this point surfactant molecules starts joining together to form aggregate spontaneously   making  micelles . At this point concentration is called CMC.In the given figure at 0.001 weight percentage surface tension is about 50 dynes/cm which further goes down with increase in weight percentage of surfactant upto weight percentage of approximately 0.011 & 35 dynes/cm of surface tension.After this point any further addition of surfactant does not reduce surface tension any further but starts formation of aggregates. This status continues even at a weight percentage of 1 also.Thus at weight percentage of 0.001 surface tension has a decreasing trend   however  at weight percentage of 1 & further more no decrease in surface tension is observed this is because further to CMC value surfactants starts making aggregates."
0	"Micelles are forming"
0	"Enter essay here.Before the CMC point (0.015 %wt) the surface tension decreases steadily with increasing surfactant concentration. After this point  the concentration decreases but with a lower rate.The CMC point is where the concentration of surfactant is enough to micelles spontaneously form in solution.As surfactant concentration increases  the surface coverage of surfactant molecules increases and the maximun coverage is reached at CMC. At that point  molecules begin to agregate into micelles. Beyond this point any new formation of micelles will have minor effects on surface tension."
0	"as the concentration increases the surface tension decreases and after the concentration reaches .05 the drop in surface tension is quite low"
0	"When this solution have low concentration of surfactants  surfactants molecules concentrate on the surface of solution. This molecules makes surface energy lower. When concentration of surfactants is higher then 0.02 wt% they start to aggregation into structure like e.g. micellas (on the surface of solution). Increasing concentration slightly change surface tension."
0	"Surfactant molecule has hydrophobic section and a hydrophilic section.when a surfactant is placed on the surface of water  the hydrophilic end is attracted to the water and immerses itself in the H2O whilst the hydrophobic section will tend to try to get as far away from the H2O as posssible.At the lowest concentrations  the immersion of the hydrophilic section of the surfactant in the H2O will act to reduce the surface tension of the water.  As the conc of the surfactant increases  the surface tension lowering effect increases in proportion to the increase in conc of surfactant.The carries on until a critical surfactant concentration is reached.  At the Critical Surfactant Concentration (CSC)  the surfactants clump together and form micelles.Micelles: a 3-d structure made of clumps of surfactants with solid/concentrated walls  where the hydrophobic ends group together and the hydrophilic ends line up side by side.  The interesting thing about a micelle is that only a fraction of the surfactant molecules are in contact with the water at any time  so an increase in surfactant concentration above the Critical Surfactant Concentration (when micelles are forming) results in a smaller decrease in H2O surface tension than an equivalent increase in surfactant conc below the CSC.At  0.001 weight percent micelles have not formed and the appearance of of the soln will be one of clear water; at  1 weight percent micelles have formed and the soln will have a blueish appearance."
0	"As more surfactant is added  the pulling apart force is less as it is easier to spread out across the entire surface. That being said  the molecules are a lot more concentrated and will have a blue tint because science says so."
0	"The surface tension is decreasing with the increasing concentration of surfactant. On LogLin plot the decrease is linear with a given slope. Begining on a certain concetration (here around 0.01 to 0.02 weigth %) the surfactant molecules start to agregate to micelles. That's why from this concentration the slope of surface tension decrease is much lower as the molecules are consumed in micelle creation process. "
0	"As more and more surfactant is added the surface tension decreases steadily with the log of the concentration.  In this concentration region the solution is clear.  At about 0.01 wt% surfactant the concentration of the surfactant is great enough that it will form micelles in the aqueous phase.  These micelles will scatter the light giving the solution a hazy or cloudy appearance.   This cloudiness will be very apparent at 1% surfactant concentration.  At 0.001 weight percent surfactant the solution will be clear."
0	"While adding more surfactant molecules the tension goes down. Then  at some point micells start to appear and tension doesn't change. "
0	"The surface tension starts out high and lowers as the concentration of surfactant increases. At .001 wt% the surface tension is just beginning to decrease. At .1 wt% the concentration of surfactant is saturated and then the surface tension is not affected by increasing the wt% of the surfactant. Using excess soap or detergent is not helpful after that point. The solution will appear cloudy at that point. "
0	"- Surfactants are compounds that reduce the surface tension of water.- A surfactant molecule is amphiphilic and interferes with the hydrogen bonding in water and reduces the cohesiveness.- The more the surfactant  less the surface tension. - At .001 wt% the surface tension is very high whereas at 1 wt% it is low. This is due to more interference with hydrogen bonds in water. "
0	"As the amount of surfactant goes up  the surface tension goes down rapidly  until it forms a micelle and only slightly decreases.  The reason for this is because the two ends of the surfactant (the hydrophobic side and the hydrophillic side) physically break the bonds of that create surface tension.  At .0001 the solution would be fairly clear  and at 1 the solution would become milky."
0	"(at STP in pure water) The introduction of surfactant to the aqueous solution shows a dramatic decrease in surface tension. This is due to the surfactant partitioning into the interface (and arresting oil if present) to reduce the free energy of the interface. This is measured as surface tension. When the coverage of the interface with surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. Whilst there is still a decrease in the surface tension  the surfactant is soluble and free to move about in an aqueous solution at it's lowest energy state. When to concentration of surfactant reaches a critical concentration (CMC)  the solubility of the surfactant has been reached. (0.01 wt% in this graph). At this point  the energy required to keep the surfactant in solution is no longer at its lowest state  so to decrease the free energy the surfactant precipitates out of solution by forming micelles. Subsequent addition of surfactant causes no significant change (virtually none) in the surface tension and only adds to the formation of more or larger micelle formations.  (1 wt% on the graph)"
0	"On the surface  the interactions with the neighboring molecules are limited and weaker  resulting in a higher free energy and reduced inter-molecular hydrogen bonding of the molecules.This causes the high surface tension at 0.001% wt of surfactant.At 1% wt  the bonds of water molecules in the surface are saturated which lower the free energy which lower the surface tension.."
0	"For a concentration of the surfactant below its cmc the surface tension drops linearly with increasing concentration of the surfactant. The surfactant is hardly soluable in the water but sticks on the surface with its hydrophile ends inside and its hydrophobe ends outside of the water. The solution is transparent. At the cmc of about 0.015 wt% the surfactants start to organise themselves into micelles. The surface tension does not drop much any more. Instead the solubility increases and the micelles dissolve in the water. The solution starts to scatter the light and is not transparent any more. "
0	"As the weight percent of the surfancant increases  the surface tension decreases. This is because the surfactant segregates to the surface of the aqueous solution. Once the weight percent reaches the critical micelle concentration  the surfactant molecules begin aggregating into micelles and no longer affect the surface tension."
0	"The solution will differ at 0.001 weight percent and 1 weight because of the micelles. The micelles disperse color  so with less micelles  the less the solution will look blue  while the more micelles there are  the more blue it will look."
0	"as the quatity of surfact increase  the molecules to which the surfactant is attach is covered by the surfactant molecules until is completely covered... where the surface tension maintains constant"
0	"As more surfactant is added to the water  it is lowering the surface tension steadily  until it hits the CMC or critical micelle concentration  after which point the surfactant essentially stops lowering the surface tension and begins to form micelles  or aggregates that are soluable because all of the polar portions of the molecules are surrounding a layer of nonpolar/nonsoluable portions of the molecules. Because these nanometer-scale particles are soluable  the solution will become cloudy and blue-ish once the CMC is reached. Thus the solution will go from clear/layered at 0.001 weight percent to cloudy and blue-ish at 1 weight percent."
0	"Addition of the surfactant reduces the surface tension.  At a concentration just above 0.1% (the c.m.c.)  the surfactant spontaneously forms micelles and the reduction in surface tension essentially stays constant as more surfactant is added.  At low concentrations (e.g. 0.0001%) the solution will be colourless but at concentrations above the c.m.c.  (e.g. 1%) the micelles will diffract light & turbidity will develop."
0	"In smaller weights of the surfactant we have smaller spheres  thus greater surgace tension. Micelles that created in the solution disperse the light. And as a result we have a blue tone in the color of the solution."
0	"As more and more surfactant molecules are added  more bonds between water molecules break  so  the surface tension of the solution decreases. When the critical micelle concentration is reached  then the amphiphiles start organizing themselves forming micelles  so the concentration of surfactant can increase further without affecting the surface tension too much.At 0.001 percent weight  before reaching the CMC  no micelles are formed  so the solution appears transparent and it does not scatter light. At 1 percent weight  a considerable amount of micelles are formed  so the solution appears cloudy because of scattering of light by the micelles."
0	"The surface tension decreases as the concentration increases until it reaches the CMC where micelles formation starts to take place and  hence the surface tension becomes constant and shows no further decrease. The solution will look like a colloid and will be bluish due to scattering of light by the particles of the solution."
0	"These molecules have lots of C therefore in the .1 concentration the number of surfactant molecules is big enough to change the solution into more surfactant molecules and less water therefore the hydrophabic parts start to gather and the surface tension will reduced."
0	"The solubility is increasing.  Also  water tension appears to be decreasing. "
0	"Surface tension goes down with concentration because there is more surfactant present to use up the free bonds on the surface. At about 0.01% weight the surface tension n longer decreases  instead any additional surfactant goes into making micelles. When micelles form  they are of a size that scatters blue light preferentially  so a bluish color appears on the surface."
0	"it will be blue-ish"
0	"Enter essay here.  As the weight % surfactant concentration approaches 0.02%  the surfactant reaches the CMC value for the surfactant.  Further increase in surfactant concentration does not reduce the surface tension of the aqueous solution.  The solution at 1% weight will appear cloudy compared to a clear solution at the 0.0001% weight solution."
0	"When the percentage increases  the surface tension diminishes in the left part  until it saturates."
0	"As we keep adding the surfactant to water  the surfactant goes to the surface decreasing the surface tension till a point beyond which it forms micelles. In this case the micelle forms at ~ 0.01 wt% of surfactant. At 1 wt% surfactant we will have micelles and at 0.001 wt% where the surfactant will be adsorbed at the surface. Therefore  the surfactant dispersion will appear as a bluish tinge at 1 % wt surfactant concentration while at 0.001 wt% concentration it will appear transparent"
0	"The surface tension drops sharply as the weight % of surfactant increases until about 0.01% weight and then it levels off. There is greater surface tension at 0.001% than at 1%."
0	"As the surfactant molecules reach a critical concentration at about 0.02%  they start to aggregate and exclude water  forming structures with their hydrophobic ends pointed towards the centre  and their hydrophilic ends at the surface in contact with water. This reduces the potential energy of the repulsion between the polar water molecules and the non-polar hydrophobic ends of the surfactant. The aggregations of surfactant molecules are large enough to scatter light  particularly at the blue end of the visible spectrum. "
0	"Let's consider the case whereby the concentration of the surfactant molecule increases from 0.001 weight percent (wt%) to 1 wt%. The aqueous solution will be initially clear/transparent. The surface tension of the solution will rapidly decrease as the concentration increases. Then at a certain level of concentration known as the CMC (Critical Micelle Concentration)  the surface tension remains largely unchanged as the concentration increases. Likewise  as the concentration reaches the CMC the solution becomes cloudy and the turbidity increases as the concentration increases.The CMC concentration  occurs when the surfactant molecules exists in such quantity that they can aggregate into structures. For example  little spheres of Micelles  with the hydrophilic heads of the surfactant molecules forming a shell of a sphere  while the hydrophobic tails group together inside the shell because they are repulsed by the water molecules of the aqueous solution.Because these micelles aggregate together  they block light; giving rise to the cloudiness."
0	"   As more surfactant is added to a concentration of 0.001 the surface tension is lowered. At a concentration of  0.3 it reaches the critical micelle concentration. It starts to form micelles and the surface tension barely changes being almost the same at a concentration of 0.1."
0	"Feedback not yet available. Reload to check again. Once the problem is graded  this message will be replaced with the grader's feedback"
0	"As weight percent of surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases because the surfactant bonds to the surface reducing the energy of the unbonded surface molecules.  At some critical point however the surface becomes saturated with surfactant and addition of more surfactant results in formation of micelles which leave the surface and enter the bulk fluid.  So at 0.001 weight percent  the surface has very little surfactant and high surface tension  but at 1 weight percent  the surface is saturated and the solution has micelles in it."
0	"In the low concentration regimes  the surfactants are accumulating at the surface of the water and sticking into the air. This reduces the surface energy of the surface  because it is a stable  pseudobonding interaction that lowers the energy of the configuration.Once the concentration gets above 0.01%  though  the surface is saturated with surfactants. The surfactants start to aggregate into micelles  and the critical micelle concentration has been reached. The amount of surfactants on the surface stays constant  and so  approximately  does the surface tension."
0	"As we keep adding surfactant to water  water's surface tension will keep decreasing  until it reach a critical point which is the weight percent increase to about 0.011%.After that critical point the drop in water's surface tension is reduced  even those we keeping adding surfactant  water's surface tension does not show great difference. This is because after the critical point  surfactant start to organize themselves to form micelle  surfactant molecule on the water surface remain more or less the same even those concentration of surfactant keep increasing  while the extra surfactant formed micelle and move around with the water molecule as micelle has a hydrophilic surrounding."
0	"Surface tension declines as surfactant is added because the hydrophilic ends of the surfactant molecules disrupt the intermolecular attractions among the surface water molecules.  As the concentration of surfactant reaches the critical micelle concentration (CMC)  from the graph at just below 0.02 percent by weight  the surfactant begins to form micelles  which disperse into the water  causing it to become turbid.  Little further change is observed in the surface tension beyond this point."

0	"In this graph it shows that as concentration of a surfactant increases the surface tension decreases. This is because the surfactant has a hydrophobic end that sticks out of the water and a hydrophilic portion that reacts with the water. This scenario decreases surface tension until the critical point where the graph changes slope dramatically where an increase in the surfactant has little effect on surface tension. At .0001 concentration the small concentration of the surfactant is not large enough to effect surface tension  but as it is added to solution it decreases the surface tension dramatically. At 1 wt% the surfactant is past the critical micelle point where the surfactant starts to organize and the surfactant does not affect surface tension."

0	"Surfactants are substances used to reduce the surface tension of water and thus helping to remove non polar dust particles from the substrate to be cleaned. Surfactants contain one hydrophilic end which dissolves in water and a hydrophobic end which dissolves the non-polar molecules. As surfactants are used to lower the surface tension  it is found that with increase in amount of the surfactants  the surface tension decreases. This is depicted in the graph as a line which is going down according to the increase in concentration. It is also observed that after a particular point the graph remains unchanged and is parallel to the x axis. At this point  the surfactant molecule together with water and non-polar molecules aggregates spontaneously to form micelles and this concentration is called Critical Micelles Concentration. From this point there is no change in surface tension with addition of surfactants. Even though we change the concentration scale from .001 to 1 percentage weight  the shape of the graph will be the same. But the line will be starting form a lower value of surface tension  but the plateau will start appearing form the same concentration  being the CMC is unchanged. So the shape of the graph will be almost same as the original plot  but the line starts from a surface tension value below 50."
0	"As surfactants are added to the solution  they remain on the surface due to the hydrophilic groups and reduce the surface tension.  Once the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached at about 0.013%  the surfactants arrange themselves into micelles which can then diffuse throughout the volume of the solution.  At this point the solution becomes turbid due to light scattering off the micelles  and the solubility of the surfactant increases due to being able to diffuse into the entire volume of the solution rather than just the surface."

0	"Enter essay here.As the concentration of surfactant increases  more of the surfactant is present at the surface of the solution.  The surfactant disrupts the bonding of the water molecules at the surface  and so decreases the surface tension.  Above a certain concentration (in this case about 0.02 wt%) the surfactant starts to self-assemble into micelles- organisations of many surfactant molecules within the solution.  Less of the added surfactant is therefore available to reduce the surface tension  so the reduction in surface tension per unit added surfactant decreases."
0	"In the steeply sloping part of the plot  up to about 0.02% by weight  the surface concentration of surfactant is increasing. This results in progressive reduction in surface tension. Beyond 0.02%  the surface is more or less saturated with surfactant  and further addition results in the formation of micelles in which the non-polar parts of the surfactant form a hydrophobic centre  with the polar parts forming a hydrophilic surface to the spherical micelles. This occurs within the bulk of the solution  and no longer has a significant effect on the surface tension. The solution prior to formation of micelles is clear  but micelle formation results in progressively increasing opalescence  because of differing refractive indices between aqueous solution and the lipophilic cores. The intensity of this increases with concentration of surfactant."

Aqueous surface tension continues decreasing until we reach a concentration of surfactant of about 0.015 weight percent.  From that concentration on  the surface tension does not vary. This concentration is known as the critical mycelle concentration  where the surfactant molecules start to aggregate and form mycelles. This mycelles can then move deeper into the aqueous solution and they disperse in it. More ycelles will form if we add more surfactant.

Therefore the surface tension levels off even as the surfactant concentration is further increased.

0	"The ability of surfactants to reduce surface tension of water to a low value is a fundamental characteristic which results in highly efficient and effective performance in a wide range of applications. By changing the surface tension of a solution  the surfactant solution becomes wet better. Instead of beading up  the solution will spread on the surface or penetrate more rapidly into fibers.Surfactants changing the surface tension of water  breaking up the forces holding the water molecules along the interface. The surface tension is generally expressed dynes / cm or mN / m. Two measures surface tension generally carried provide two different types of data.Equilibrium surface tension (typically an aqueous surfactant solution) indicates the effectiveness of a surfactant is to reduce the surface tension of water (72 dynes / cm). For example  an aqueous 0.1% Tergitol TMN-6 (90%) of surfactant has an equilibrium surface tension of 26 dyne / cm  indicating excellent wetting properties.Enter essay here."
0	"The surfactant initially forms a surface layer on the top of the water. This reduces the surface tension of the water-surfactant mixture. As the concentration is increased there are more surfactant molecules per area of the surface  this continues to reduce the surface tension of the mixture. Once the critical micelle concentration is reached  the surface has become saturated in surfactant. Adding addition surfactant now begins to form micelles suspended in the mixture. The change in surface tension with increased surfactant now becomes much smaller. As the micelles approach the size of visible light  Rayleigh scattering happens and the blue light is scattered more giving the mixture a blue tint. As the surfactant concentration is increases  more micelles form increase the amount of light scattered and the turbidity of the mixture increases. "

Micelles are accumulations of surfactants  with the hydrophilic group pointing out of the micelle and the hydrophobic group pointing in to the micelle.

When this effect occurs  surface tension doesn't change  because if we add a surfactant it won't affect surface tension  it will rather form more miceles.Solution at 1% weight will look a little blueish because of miceles which are making a solution coloidal. At 0.001% weight solution will be clear."
0	"Surfactants lower surface tension to a certain point and then start forming micelles.  When this occurs you begin to see nanometer sized particles that cloud the water and begin to give it a bluish tint"
0	"In a first instance  as you add more surfactant to the solution  the surface tension of the water decreases  until it starts forming micelles (reaching the cmc)  its own structures (spheres or surfaces) with the hydrophobic parts of the molecule of the surfactant getting together. The solution should change in turbidity/color after the cmc  because micelles scatter light differently."
0	"Below the CMC (~0.01 %wt)  the surfactant is essentially soluble in the aqueous phase  and is largely partitioning to the surface  decreasing the surface tension. As more surfactant is added  the surface tension continues to decrease. The solution is still clear. Below the CMC  increased concentration of surfactant leads to increased numbers of micelles but no increased solubility or partitioning to the surface region  hence the tension remains unchanged and the liquid starts to cloud."
0	"As the weight % of the surfactant increases  it is reducing the surface tension  as the surfactant molecules start to bond with the solution. Once the weight % reaches the Critical Micelle Concentration(CMC) point  the surfactant molecules start to aggregate into Micelles  and the bluish tinge characteristic of Micelles will appear."
0	"Adding the surfactants is reducing the surface tension up until .02 wt %. At that point the concentration of the surfactants reached the critical micelle concentration  and no longer drastically reduces the surface tension. The solution at .001 wt % is clear  while the 1 wt % should be cloudy."
0	"the more surfactants you add the lower the surface tension gets."
0	"At first  as the concentration of surfactant increases  the surface tension drops because the surfactant which is on the surface of water. This is happening  for instante  at 0.001weight percent. When CMC is reached (at 0.012 %)  the sufactant form micelles and surface tension barely decreases. At 0.1 weight percent  there are micelles in the solution  so there is turbudity."
0	"concentration of surfant exceeds 0.01%  they will form micelle"
0	"At lower concentrations on the left side of the graph  the number of surfactant molecules is not sufficient for micelles to form. As such  those amphiphiles will collect near the surface with their hydrophilic ends beneath the surface layer and this will serve to reduce the surface energy of the water and  consequently  the surface tension.As we have seen in the lecture  once the concentration reaches a critical point(cmc)  the amphiphiles will organize into micelle structures. These structures will reduce the marginal effect of added surfactants  as new surfactants introduced will no longer serve to lower to the surface energy/tension to the same degree; rather  they will contribute to the formation of more and larger micelle structures. The micelles  by shielding their hydrophobic parts from the water  do not affect the surface energy to the same degree.The formation of these structures will result in optical properties of the solution changing  from cloudiness due to the presence of macroscopic structures in the liquid  to the formation of surface bubbles and other aggregations of surfactants near the surface."
0	"at 0.001 weight the surfactant stays on surface  at bigger concentration it forms micelle."
0	"We start to add surfactants to the water and at 0.001 weight we see that the surface tension is lower than when we started. It keeps getting lower  as we add more surfactant and at about 0.02 we see that the surface tension doesn't change that much anymore  we hit a plateau. At that point we have reached the CMC (critical micelle concentration) and we start creating micelles. Above this CMC point  the more surfactant we add  the more micelles we create. When weight is 1  the aquous solution gets bluish  because the way the particles scatter light."
0	"Surface tension reduces when surfactants are added to aqueous solutions. As the concentration of surfactants is increased from 0.0001 weight percent to 0.01 weight percent  the aqueous surface tension reduces sharply until beyond a certain concentration i.e  0.01 weight percent  the effect of the increase in surfactant concentration causes minimal/almost negligible change in aqueous surface tension.The appearance of the solution at 0.001 weight percent versus 1 weight percent will remain relatively the same since at both concentrations  the value of the surface tension is almost the same."
0	" The trend of the change in the surface tension changes when the concentration of surfactants arrives in the critical micelle concentration  at this point  the surface tension stops decreasing and keeps constant. In the points before the CMC  like in the point where the weight percent is equal to 0.001  you can't observe micelles so  the turbidity is equal 0. In the points after the CMC  like in the point where the weight percent is equal to 1  you can observe micelles so  the turbidity is greather than 0  because the micelles present in the solution can scatter the light."
0	"As the concentration of surfactants in the water increases the surface tension decreases because the surfactants arrange themselves on the surface so that the hydrophilic end is in the water and the hydrophobic out of it. But at the CMC surface tension decreases more gradually because the surfactants begin forming micelles. At .0001 weight percent the solution while be clear but at 1 which is greater then the CMC it will have a blueish color because of the micelles."
0	"At low concentrations  there is hight surface tension and they al accumulate on the surface  after a while  there will be a decrease in surface tension accompanied by self assembly of the surfactants beyond the critical micelle concentration."
0	"The surface tension decreases initially as the amount of surfactant increases. At about 0.02% micells form and then surface tension does not change anymore."
0	"From the graph  as the weight percent surfactant increases  surface tension of the fluid decreases.  This is the result of decreased hydrogen bonding due to micelles formation.  At about 0.01-0.02 wt%  critical micelle concentration is reached  and additional surfactants does not further reduce the surface tension but instead go into the existing micelles.  This is why the surface tension of the liquid no longer decreases past the CMC.  Typically  more micelles concentrated solution is more bluish."
0	"The surface tension decreases when we increase the concentration of surfactant  until we reach a point of concentrationn (CMC) when the surfactant tends to create structures such as micelles  and the surface tension stops decreasing (that would be the 0.03  more or less). The solution with a 0.001weight percent of surfactant would be clearer than the one at 1 weight percent."
0	"The graph shows that the surface tension clearly decreases until the percentage of surfactant reaches 0.2 approximately. At this point  the molecules are dispersed  for example if the surfactant percentage is 0 001  there are not enough molecules to form micelles.The surface tension drops to 35 dynes / cm. At this point about descends very little with increasing the surfactant percentage. This is because the cmc point was reached.  So when the surfactant percentaje is 1  molecules have formed micelles"
0	"As surfactant is initially added to water  the surface tension decreases due to the surfactant molecules aligning at the air water interface  with the polar end dissolving in the water  the non polar end in the air. This reduces the strength of the water hydrogen bonds up to the Critical Micelle Concentration of around 0.015wt% surfactant in water.  As the concentration increases further  the surfactant forms micelles  ordered structures of surfactant with the non polar groups at the center  the polar groups facing the water.  These may be spherical  tubular or lamellar in shape.Up to the CMC  the solution will be clear  above the CMC it may become hazy  with a blueish color as the micelles form and scatter light (blue more so than red)."
0	"When the surfactant concentration in the water reaches a determined value micelles starts to forming in way to aggregate molecules of the substance. So  because the surfactant is no longer completely spreading itself in the water surface the aqueous surface tension stops changing. The system  at 1 wt.%  diffracts light  is no more transparent like when the surfactant conc. was 0.001 wt.%. "
0	"As the concentration of surfactant increases as a function of wt % of water (presumed) solution  the surface tension is decreases until it reaches the critical micelle concentration  at which point there is minimal subsequent effect. this occurs because the hydrophobic component of the surfactant seeks the water interface  and separates itself from the water  while the hydrophillic portion remains in the water. The surfactant decreases the surface energy portion of the surface tension  thus lowering the surface tension. The presence of the surfactant also scatters light due to diffraction of light   thus creating a slight bluish tint to the surface."
0	"The surface tension is dropping as the surfactant is added. At certain point  the surface tension doesn't change anymore  as the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached and molecules are starting to aggregate into micelles.The solution at 0.001 weight percent will be clear/transparent  and at 1 weight percent it will be bluish in color (because of presence of micelles and their ability to scatter light)."
0	"As you add this surfactant  the surface tension of the solution reduces until  at a point around 0.02% wt.  the surfactant begins to form micelles.  Further surfactant does not further reduce surface tension.  In addition it milkens the solution."

0	"The surfactant is soluble below .02% by weight. At higher concentrations  micelles (or tubes) form. This takes less energy than dissolution. The appearance begins to cloud at the higher percentages since the micelles are large enough to scatter light."
0	"Solution will be more turbid as more surfactant is present."
0	"Below about .02 wt%  the surfactant molecules are filling up the surface of the liquid  lowering its surface tension.  After about .02wt%  the surfactant molecules begin to form micelles in the bulk of the solution rather than populating the surface  and so have little effect on surface tension.  At .001 wt% there will be no micelles to scatter light  so the liquid will appear clear.  At 1 wt %  there will be micelles to scatter light and the solution will appear cloudy."
0	"The solution starts with a surface tension of 60 dynes / cm and with increasing the amount of surfactant decreases the surface tension in the solution to a value of 35 dynes / cm by micelle formation. When the solution is saturated micelle formation ceases and the surface tension remains approximately constant in the solution. Through 0 001 to 1% of the solution changes to a more uniform appearance to an irregular appearance due to the presence of micelles"
0	"Hydrophilic parts of surfactants are forming bonds with water (electrostatic interaction) and hydrophobic parts form bonds with air (Van der Waals interaction)  so surface tension becomes smaller and smaller. At critical micelle concentration surface tension stops declining  because surfactants tend to form micelles inside   the liquid.Surface tension at 0.001 weight percent is bigger (50) than at 1 percent (35) due to lack of surfactants."
0	"Presence of surfactants makes the surface tension being reduced.Higher the concentration of surfactants is lower the tension becomes.However there is a critical concentration point (aprox 0.01%). Concentration above the critical point make surfactants act less efficient."
0	"the more surfactants you add the lower the surface tension gets until the amount of surfactants exceeds the amount of original substance because then the surfactant has a surfaces tension itself."
0	"The surface tension goes down as surfactants are added because they go to the surface. The surfactants will eventually form micelles  and that happens when the slope of the line changes. At 1% weight  the micelles will be visible [under a microscope]. At 0.001% weight  the surfactants won't be visible."

These spheres deduct surface tension because the innner parts of these are carbon chaines(oil) and outer parts  are familir with water. But  whene concentration is higher than about 0.2wt% surface tension is not decreased so much or almost constant. Because then the solution is sarturated and these sphere connnect each other. So  the solution of1wt% has more viscousity than the solution of 0.001wt%  and we can apper it is almost pure sufactant.  "
0	"As more surfactant molecules are added to the solution  eventually a critical mass of them is reached  called the critical micelle concentration  where the surfactants begin to spontaneously form micelles  amphiphile layers that prevent further addition of surfactants from affecting surface tension.

0	"At low concentrations (approximately below 0.01%) surfactant will seggregate to the surface of the water  and its hydrophilic end will stay in contact with the surface of water  lowering its surface tension. Surface tension lowers to a limit with increasing concentration of the surfactant. That limit is the CMC (Critical Micelles concentration)  for concentrations above that limit the surfactant will start forming micelles  and thus the increasing on the effect on surface tension will stop. Above the CMC surface tension remains almost constant because any increase inthe concentration of surfacttant will form micelles  will not seggregate to the surface. Those micelles  with diameters between 3 and 50 nanometers  will scatter light passing through the solution  making water white or blue."
0	"With the addition of surfactants  they form small aggregates of molecules to form micelles  which reduce the surface tension of the liquid.From a certain concentration of micelles - the critical micelle concentration - no longer occurs the formation of such structures  which stabilizes the decrease."
0	"When concentration is small  molecules are spread on the surface and make surface tension smaller with increasing concentration of the surfacant. At about .02% concentration  is high enough fo micelles to form. Micelles are small balls of surfacant molecules (hydrophobic parts are inside  so they don't touch water and hydrophilic parts are outside)  that prevent further change of surface tension. New molecules just join or form new micelles. Molecules in a micelle change only surface tension on the surface of the micelle  so surface tension of the solution at 1% is almost constant."

0	"Surfactant molecules have hydrophilic heads  which immerse themselves in water  and hydrophobic tails  which stick out of the water. The tails cause the molecules to remain at the surface of the water  while the heads reduce surface tension in the water  by adding attractive forces at the surface to counter those from deeper within the water. As more surfactant is added to the water  the surface tension will decrease  as shown in the above graph  until at a certain concentration  shown by the intersection of the two lines on the graph  the surfactant molecules begin bonding together  forming structures known as micelles  with the heads of the molecules on the outside and the tails on the inside  preventing the surface tension from falling as quickly. This can result in the mixture becoming bluish  as may be happening beyond the intersection point."

0	"The bend in the line is at the concentration for the CMC  or critical micelle point. At this point  micelles start to form in the surfactant. The solution will appear more cloudy or turbid  as the micelles scatter incoming light."
0	"As we add more amount of surfactant decreases the surface tension. This is because the surfactant is capable of dispersing liquid molecules into small droplets.From what we call critical micellas concentration (MCM)  superfical tension becomes constant. This is because from this surfactant concentration  the surfactant molecules begin to form micelles.The differences between the two concentrations of surfactant are that from the MCM:1. The solution begins to have a bluish color (turbidity increases) because it scatters light.2. Decreases the equivalent conductivity of the solution.3. Increases the solubility of the solution.4. Decreases the self diffusion of the solution."
0	"(at STP in pure water) The introduction of surfactant to the aqueous solution shows a dramatic decrease in surface tension. This is due to the surfactant partitioning into the interface (and arresting oil if present) to reduce the free energy of the interface. This is measured as surface tension. When the coverage of the interface with surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. Whilst there is still a decrease in the surface tension  the surfactant is soluble and free to move about in an aqueous solution at it's lowest energy state. When to concentration of surfactant reaches a critical concentration (CMC)  the solubility of the surfactant has been reached. (0.01 wt% in this graph). At this point  the energy required to keep the surfactant in solution is no longer at its lowest state  so to decrease the free energy the surfactant precipitates out of solution by forming micelles  giving a bluish the appearance to the solution. Subsequent addition of surfactant causes no significant change (virtually none) in the surface tension and only adds to the formation of more or larger micelle formations.  (1 wt% on the graph)"
0	"Initially  at a concentration of 0.0001  the surfactant molecule is situated on the surface of the solution.  The hydrophobic tails sticking out into the air.  As the concentration increases thee surface tension decreases until a critical point is reached at which point the surfactants spontaneously form into micelles.   As the concentration increases the surface tension of the micelles remains relatively constant."
0	"The surface tension of a solution drops rapidly until the concentration of a surfactant reaches  .03 wt% which is in this case the CMC and surfactant molecules start to  aggreagate into groups and therefore the surface tension stays pretty much unchanged. Surfactants bond with water molecules but thanks to their hydrophobic parts they completely don't mix (or bond). They bond to surface molecules and therefore reduce the cohesive forces that influence surface water molecules. The solution should seem slightly blueish."
0	"Surface tension of water begins to fall when you add surfactant. After more and more surfactant added you get to the CMC (critical micelle concentration)  and surface tension of the solution doesn't change. Why? Because the surfactant is not in the surface anymore stick to the air! now there are enough molecules of surfactant to associate between them. The appearance of the solution from transparent (low concentration of surfactant) becomes opaque because the micelles begin to diffract light."
0	"The surface tension drops while the amount of surfactant increases in the solution  until it reaches the CMC and micelles start to form. At that moment  the surface tension remains unchanged although there is still an increase in the concentration of surfactant. At low concentration the solution is clear but at concentrations above the CMC  when micelles start to form  the solution becomes a suspension and those particles produce scattering of light. "
0	"Adding surfactant to the solution will decrease the surface tension until a certain point. At that point  concentration of surfactant is high enough to allow micelle formation.At 0.001 wt%  nothing is visible.At 1 wt% the solution scatters light because of the micelles."
0	"At low concentrations  the surfactant molecules adsorb on the surface of water  with the hydrophilic part interacting with water and the hydrophobic part pointing outward. As a result  the surface tension decreases with higher concentrations of surfactants. For some critical concentration  however  the surface tensions stops decreasing so much. This occurs when the surfactant molecules begin forming micelles  that is  macromolecular structures with the hydrophobic tails pointing inside and the hydrophilic tails outside. These micelles do not stay at the surface  but they dissolve in the volume of water. For low concentrations  such as 0.001 weight %. the solution will appear clear  whereas for concentrations larger than the Critical Micelle Concentration  such as 1 weight %  the solution will became tinted or turbid because of the light scattering caused by the micelles."
0	"The surfacants will start to lower the surface tension of the solution. Once the critical micelle concentration CMC  is reached  the formation of micelle occurs by aggregation of the surfacants molecules. The surface tension remains constant from that point on."
0	"Ambiphilic molecules will line up on the aqueous solution surface with the hydrophilic end in the solution and the hydrophobic end will stick up vertically into the air. The presence of these molecules disrupts the surface lowering the cohesive forces between the water molecules hence lowering the surface tension. Another arrangement of the surfactant is to form micelles within the body of the solution. At 0.02 wt% the surface becomes saturated with surfactant and micelles are favoured. This is the critical micelle concentration. From hereon the graph flattens as their is no major change in surface tension. As for appearance  there will be no apparent change up to the critical micelle concentration after which the solution will appear blue due to light scattering this will may eventually disappear as the surfactant concentration increases due to larger particles scattering blue light less."
0	"Surfactant lowers surface tension of water  increasing the concentration of surfactant lowers the surgace tension more and more  until a cricyical concentration known as c.m.c. Is reached. Thereafter the surfactant molecules aggregate into micelles  and the surface tension stays by and large constant. In the plot  the c.m.c. Appears to be near 0.01  so below that  say 0.001 concentration  ther isn't any micelle formation. At 1 weight  there ll be abundant micelle formation."
0	"Surfactants make superficial tension of water decrease  its value will go down as the concentration of surfactanct rises. This is true until a certain value of concentration of surfactanct  called critical micelle concentration (CMC). This is the concentration at which the molecules of surfactanct start to organize themselves as aggregates  micelles  leaving their hydrophilic part in contact with water and the hydrophobic part of the molecule to the inside of the micelle. From this value of concentration and up  surface tension will not decrease significantly.The solution with a conc. of surfactanct beyond CMC will look different to water or a low conc. solution because micelles reflect light of diverse wavelenght so will give the solution some colour."
0	"In the low percentage zone the micelles are actively forming  until the point of about 0.03 is reached  from where on the solvent stays rather stable and saturated and this phase should be less transparent then low percentage solvent."
0	"Surface tension decreases as surfactant is added. Surfactants usually contain hydrophobic chains with hydrophilic heads. These hydrophilic parts can now replace some water molecules on the surface. As a result there are less cohesive forces between water molecules on the surface due to the interjection of solute particles. This reduces the surface tension. As more and more surfactant is added  there is continuous decrease in surface tension until the surface tension reaches a minimum and does not change after the maximum number of solute particles that can be present at the surface along with solvent is reached.As far as appearances go  in general  solutions with high surface tension will have droplet like appearance (or more viscous) while low surface tension liquids will be more smoother at the surface."
0	"Initially the addition of surfactant molecules causes a drop in surface tension as they align on the surface with hydrophilic heads in the water and hydrophobic tails sticking out. As the surfactant concentration increases  the surface tension drops until the CMC is reached  here at a weight percent of around.02. There the surface tension stabilizes. From that point on  further addition of surfactant results in micelles forming instead of the surfactant molecules continuing to align at the surface. Micelles are effectively particles and scatter light  so the solution will become increasingly cloudy as the weight percent approaches 1."

At the critical micelle concentration (0.12 wt%)aggregation occurs which no longer allows for surface tension declines.  Micelles form because once there is sufficient surfactant concentration the surface energy is negative.  The appearance of the 0.001 wt % solution will be transparent as little light is reflected; however at 1 wt micelles have formed and a blueish light is reflected and the solution appears cloudy. "

The surfacants start building so called micelles that can be of various shape like spheres  tubes etc. The appearance of the sollution goes from clear at the 0.001 weight percent to hazy at the 1 weight percent mark. This happens  because the micelles aggregate to small particles that refract light."

These molecules have decided to join one another  aggregate spontaneouslyto create these things called micelles.Once we get above this critical micelle concentration - in 1 % point we start to see these nanometer scale particles that scatter light. And it gets a little bluish tinge because of the way light scatters atdifferent wavelengths. And these can form aggregates  all kinds of complexity these surfactants."

0	"A surfactant reduces the surface tension  therefore if the surfactant has a lower molecular weight at 0.0001 it has a smaller area to act upon and the surface tension is high but as you look at the graph the surface tension drops as the molecular weight increases.  At about 0.1 weight percent  a micelle is formed and the surface tension is constant because it has reached the critical micelle concentration.  At 1 weight percent the micelle will start to scatter light and it will have a blue tinge as compared to the straight aliphatic surfactant which is colorless at 0.0001 weight percernt"
0	"As soon as the surfactant reaches a specific concentration  it starts to aggregate. It causes that it stops changing surface tension and it starts forming micelles. In the video professor Cima mentioned a critical micelles concentration (CMC) which in case of ionic surfactants is about 10^-3 to 10^-2. That also corresponds with the graph above  so it is probable that the graph is related to the ionic surfactant. As for the appearance  the more surfactant you put into the water after the CMC  the less transparent the solution will be  since there will be more impurities (small particles  micelles) that will scatter the light."
0	"- Adding surfactant to an aqueous solution will decrease its surface tension because the hydrophobic tails of molecules of this surfactant will stick out of the surface of the aqueous solution and partially screen the tendency of the surface molecules of the aqueous solution to attract and bond to each other.- The surface tension of the aqueous solution will be constant after a certain weight percent of surfactant is reached(nearly 0.01). At this point  the screening effect of the surfactant is maximum and micelles begin to form.- 0.001 wt% is relatively clear because it doesn't contain micelles (macro-molecules).- 1 wt% is turbid because it contains micelles (macr-molecules) that are big enough to scatter light."
0	"At first  the surface tension of the water is quickly dropping  as a result of the hydrophilic ends of the surfactants immersing themselves in the water  and disrupting the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules that gives water its high surface tension. Then  at approximately .0175% weight the concentration of surfactants has reached a point where there are enough of them to begin spontaneously form micelles  which are organizations of surfactant molecules  usually spheres  with the hydrophobic ends facing inwards and the hydrophilic ends facing outwards  towards the water. The micelles now have the ability to completely submerge in the water  as the hydrophobic ends create an outer shell which protect the inner hydrophilic ends from being exposed in the water  even when fully submerged. After this  the rate at which the surface tension of the water drops greatly decreases  as the majority of additional surfactant does not stay on the surface and disrupt hydrogen bonds there  but instead forms micelles which are fully submerged in the water.The appearance of the solution at 1 percent wt concentration will have a colored hue  usually bluish  as a result of the micelles. The micelles  which are scattered throughout the water  will be at a concentration at which they will refract and bend light  changing the color of the solution. This does not occur at 0.001 percent wt concentration  because the surfactant molecules are too few and far between to begin forming micelles. "
0	"When surfactant molecules are first introduced into water  it lowers the surface tension of the water until it reaches a critical point at around 0.02 wt%. After that point  the surfactant molecules start aggregating into micelles. Additional surfactant molecules no longer lower the surface tension and therefore the surface tension remains almost a constant. At 0.001 wt%  the water is clear. At 1% wt%  the water is turbid because the micelles formed interact with light."
0	"From the data of the plot of surface tension against the weight percent of surfactant  it shoes that the surface tension decreases progressively with increase in surfactant concentration as clearly depicted by the steep slope of the graph from a surfactant weight percent of 0.001 to about 0.038/0.04. and we notice from the second plot that beyond this point the slope becomes very small in other words very less steep. this can be accounted for by the formation of micelles. at this point the surfactant molecules are said to organise themselves to the fullest(CMC). Further increase in the concentration or weight percent in this context has little effect on the surface tension. as the weight percent approaches 1% there is physical observation  and this is seen as solution changes to a colour that scatters light. beyond this point  there is no effect on the surface tension."
0	"at 0.001 WP  the surfacants stay (float) at the air/water boundry  with the hydrophilic head stick in the water and hydrophobic tail stick toward the air; and the pull of the head at the water served to reduce the surface tension.As the concentration increases  at about 0.02 WP  micelles with a hydrophlic outer shell start to form and become  submersible  therefore additional surfacants will not reduce the surface tension by much.So at 0.001 WP  the solution should just look normal; at 1WP  micelles should be observed under microscope  and the solution may have a hue associated with it  given th lighting condition is right  because of the scattering effect of the tiny miecell particles. "
0	"Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules with hydrophobic head at one end and hydrophilic head another end. On addition of such a surfactant to water  it lowers the surface tension of the water. The hydrophilic end gets attached to the water while the hydrophobic end points away towards the air or towards other non-polar particles present.It is the general rule that as the concentration of the surfactant increases  the surface tension decreases. In the graph it is evident that as the concentration of the surfactant increase  the surface tension decreases  so the line is slopping down. In the graph after certain concentration  the line becomes a plateau.   This is because  after a particular point there is no change in surface tension with increase in concentration of the surfactant. What happen here is that all the molecules aggregates together spontaneously to form micelles. After this critical micelles concentration (CMC)  there is no change in surface tension with addition of surfactants. That is the reason why the plot goes straight after a continuous decrease until certain concentration. If the graph was plotted with 0.001% Vs 1% weight  the shape of the graph would remain the same. But the line would be starting from a surface tension below 50 and will decrease continuously until the same point on the original plot and then the surface tension would remain constant giving straight line parallel to the X axis  as in the original plot since the CMC remains the same.

0	"The micelle critical point appear to be at around 0.015wt%Below that concentration  the surfactant are dissolving in water(or at least the polar end it - the hyrophobic end sticks out ofthe water). Above the micelle critical concentration  the surfactantsspontaneously aggregate to form structures. The nature of these structures depends on characteristics of the surfactant - head size tail volume  and tail length.At 1%weight  the solution will look bluish  as the micelles act toscatter light."
0	"There are a lot of micells formed at 1 weight% of surfactant. Surface tension almost stopped to change at 0.01 weight% since all surface available in this experiment was filled by surfactant. Since that point  adding more surfactant will create more micells without changing surface tension."
0	"When the concentration of the surfactants is Low  Then the influence is higher. When the Solution is saturated  change in Tensiden is Lw."
0	"Roughly after 0.01 wt%  the solution is saturated with the surfactant  which makes the surfactant molecules to aggregate  forming micelles. The higher the concentration after the saturation point  the higher the quantity of micelles  which begin to scatter light and change the appearance of the solution from transparent to whitish to bluish at very high concentrations."
0	"Increasing surfactant fraction increases number of bonds in water  which lowers surface tension of water  until saturation occurs at .02% weight.Solution changes from no color at 0.001 to bluish color at 1"
0	"It will differ in the critical micelle concentration  below this concentration you cant form micelles"
0	"When we increase the concentration of surfactant the surface tension drops until the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached. Above this point  surface tension is roughly constant (about 35 dynas/cm)  so the difference in tension surface at 0.05% and 1% weight is no significant  but if we have a 0.001% concentration  tension is about 45 dynas/cm."
