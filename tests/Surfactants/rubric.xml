		As the surfactant concentration is increased, the surface tension of the
		solution decreases since initially surfactant molecules tend to occupy the
		space at the solution's interface.

		Beyond a certain critical concentration, the CMC, the surfact molecules
		are able to aggregate into structures such as micelles. The surface tension no
		longer drops appreciably beyond this point as the surfactant molecules that are
		added continue to produce more micelles in solution rather than sit at the
		solution-air interface.

		At 0.001 weight percent the solution will appear clear as most of the
		surfactant molecules reside at the surface. At 1 weight percent micelles have
		formed, and as micelles will scatter light, the solution will appear more
		opaque.
