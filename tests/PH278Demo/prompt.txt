	<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is currently working on its “Fifth Assessment Report,” which will summarize current knowledge on climate change and its effects, as well as plausible mitigation and adaptation strategies.  The Assessment Report will consist of three Working Groups.</p>
	 

	<p>You have been invited by the IPCC to participate in Working Group II on climate impacts and adaptation.  As part of this invitation, you are asked to identify and prioritize climate change adaptation strategies to inform a climate adaptation plan for a specific geographic region (no larger than a country and no smaller than a town). As a first step of this assignment, you must:</p>

	<p>Identify a climate change related effect (e.g., loss of fresh water supplies due to sea level rise) in a particular region (e.g., Indonesia) that poses a threat to human health (e.g., increased deaths due to diarrheal illness owing to inadequate fresh water). The region and climate threat you choose needs to be supported by scientific evidence that clearly identifies the magnitude and probability of harm to health. Please include in your response links to online resources that support your claim.</p>
